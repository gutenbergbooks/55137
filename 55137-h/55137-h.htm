<h4>CHAPTER I</h4>
<h5><a name="div1_01" href="#div1Ref_01">A STRANGE VISITOR</a></h5>
<br>

<p>&quot;A penny for your thoughts, dad,&quot;
cried Lillian, suppressing a school-girl desire to throw one of the nuts on her
plate at her father and rouse him from his brown study.</p>

<p>Sir Charles Moon looked
up with a start, and drew his bushy gray eye-brows together. &quot;Some people would
give more than that to know them, my dear.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;What sort of people?&quot; asked the
young man who sat beside Lillian, industriously cracking nuts for her
consumption.</p>

<p>&quot;Dangerous people,&quot; replied Sir Charles grimly, &quot;very dangerous,
Dan.&quot;</p>

<p>Mrs. Bolstreath, fat, fair, and fifty, Lillian's paid companion and
chaperon, leaned back complacently. She had enjoyed an excellent dinner: she was
beautifully dressed: and shortly she would witness the newest musical comedy;
three very good reasons for her amiable expression. &quot;All people are dangerous to
millionaires,&quot; she remarked, pointing the compliment at her employer, &quot;since all
people enjoy life with wealth, and wish to get the millionaire's money honestly
or dishonestly.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;The people you mention have failed to get mine, Mrs.
Bolstreath,&quot; was the millionaire's dry response.</p>

<p>&quot;Of course I speak generally
and not of any particular person, Sir Charles.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I am aware of it,&quot; he answered,
nodding and showed a tendency to relapse into his meditation, but that his
daughter raised her price for confession.</p>

<p>&quot;A sixpence for your thoughts, dad, a
shilling--ten shillings--then one pound, you insatiable person.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;My kingdom for
an explicit statement,&quot; murmured Dan, laying aside the crackers. &quot;Lillian, my
child, you must not eat any more nuts or you will be having indigestion.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I
believe dad has indigestion already.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Some people will have it very badly
before I am done with them,&quot; said Sir Charles, not echoing his daughter's
laughter; then, to prevent further questions being asked, he addressed himself
to the young man. &quot;How are things going with you, Halliday?&quot;</p>

<p>When Sir Charles
asked questions thus stiffly, Dan knew that he was not too well pleased, and
guessed the reason, which had to do with Lillian, and with Lillian's friendly
attitude towards a swain not overburdened with money--to wit, his very own
self--who replied diplomatically. &quot;Things are going up with me, sir, if you mean
aeroplanes.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Frivolous! Frivolous!&quot; muttered the big man seriously, &quot;as a
well-educated young man who wants money, you should aim at higher things.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;He
aims at the sun,&quot; said Lillian gaily, &quot;how much higher do you expect him to aim,
dad?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Aiming at the sun is he?&quot; said Moon heavily, &quot;h'm! he'll be like that
classical chap who flew too high and came to smash.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Do you mean Icarus or
Phaeton, Sir Charles?&quot; asked Mrs. Bolstreath, who, having been a governess,
prided herself upon exceptional knowledge.</p>

<p>&quot;I don't know which of the two,
perhaps one, perhaps both. But he flew in an aeroplane like Dan here, and came
to grief.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Oh!&quot; Lillian turned distinctly pale. &quot;I hope, Dan, you won't come to
grief.&quot;</p>

<p>Before the guest could reply, Sir Charles reassured his daughter.
&quot;Naught was never in danger,&quot; he said, still grim and unsmiling, &quot;don't trouble,
Lillian, my dear. Dan won't come to grief in that way, although he may in
another.&quot;</p>

<p>Lillian opened her blue eyes and stared while young Halliday grew
crimson and fiddled with the nut-shells. &quot;I don't know what you mean, dad?&quot; said
the girl after a puzzled pause.

<p>&quot;I think Dan does,&quot; rejoined her father, rising
and pushing back his chair slowly. He looked at his watch, &quot;Seven-thirty; you
have plenty of time to see your play, which does not begin until nine,&quot; he
added, walking towards the door. &quot;Mrs. Bolstreath, I should like to speak with
you.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;But, dad----&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;My dear Lillian, I have no time to wait. There is an
important appointment at nine o'clock here, and afterwards I must go to the
House. Go and enjoy yourself, but don't&quot;--here his stern gray eyes rested on
Dan's bent head in a significant way--&quot;don't be foolish. Mrs. Bolstreath,&quot; he
beckoned, and left the room.</p>

<p>&quot;Oh!&quot; sighed the chaperon-governess-companion, for
she was all three, a kind of modern Cerebus, guarding the millionaire's child.
&quot;I thought it would come to this!&quot; and she also looked significantly at Halliday
before she vanished to join her employer.</p>

<p>Lillian stared at the closed door
through which both her father and Mrs. Bolstreath had passed, and then looked at
Dan, sitting somewhat disconsolately at the disordered dinner-table. She was a
delicately pretty girl of a fair, fragile type, not yet twenty years of age, and
resembled a shepherdess of Dresden china in her dainty perfection. With her pale
golden hair, and rose-leaf complexion, arrayed in a simple white silk frock with
snowy pearls round her slender neck, she looked like a wraith of faint mist. At
least Dan fancifully thought so, as he stole a glance at her frail beauty, or
perhaps she was more like a silver-point drawing, exquisitely fine. But whatever
image love might find to express her loveliness, Dan knew in his hot passion
that she was the one girl in the world for him. Lillian Halliday was a much
better name for her than Lillian Moon.</p>

<p>Dan himself was tall and slim, dark and
virile, with a clear-cut, clean-shaven face suggestive of strength and activity.
His bronzed complexion showed an open-air life, while the eagle look in his dark
eyes was that new vast-distance expression rapidly being acquired by those who
devote themselves to aviation. No one could deny Dan's good looks or clean life,
or daring nature, and he was all that a girl could desire in the way of a fairy
prince. But fathers do not approve of fairy princes unless they come laden with
jewels and gold. To bring such to Lillian was rather like taking coals to
Newcastle since her father was so wealthy; but much desires more, and Sir
Charles wanted a rich son-in-law. Dan could not supply this particular
adjective, and therefore--as he would have put it in the newest slang of the
newest profession--was out of the fly. Not that he intended to be, in spite of
Sir Charles, since love can laugh at stern fathers as easily as at bolts and
bars. And all this time Lillian stared at the door, and then at Dan, and then at
her plate, putting two and two together. But in spite of her feminine intuition,
she could not make four, and turned to her lover--for that Dan was, and a
declared lover too--for an explanation. &quot;What does dad mean?&quot; Dan raised his
handsome head and laughed as grimly as Sir Charles had done earlier. &quot;He means
that I shan't be asked to dinner any more.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Why? You have done nothing.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;No;
but I intend to do something.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;What's that?&quot; Dan glanced at the closed door and
seeing that there was no immediate chance of butler or footmen entering took her
in his arms. &quot;Marry you,&quot; he whispered between two kisses. &quot;There's no intention
about that,&quot; pouted the girl; &quot;we have settled that ever so long ago.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;So your
father suspects, and for that reason he is warning Mrs. Bolstreath.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Warning
the dragon,&quot; said Miss Moon, who used the term quite in an affectionate way,
&quot;why, the dragon is on our side.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I daresay your father guesses as much. For
that reason I'll stake my life that he is telling her at this moment she must
never let us be together alone after this evening. After all, my dear, I don't
see why you should look at me in such a puzzled way. You know well enough that
Sir Charles wants you to marry Curberry.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Marry Lord Curberry,&quot; cried Lillian,
her pale skin coloring to a deep rose hue; &quot;why I told dad I wouldn't do that.&quot;
&quot;Did you tell dad that you loved me?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;No. There's no need to,&quot; said the girl
promptly. Dan coughed drily. &quot;I quite agree with you,&quot; he said rising, &quot;there's
no need to, since every time I look at you, I give myself away. But you surely
understand, darling, that as I haven't a title and I haven't money, I can't have
you. Hothouse grapes are for the rich and not for a poor devil like me.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;You
might find a prettier simile,&quot; laughed Lillian, not at all discomposed, although
she now thoroughly understood the meaning of her father's abrupt departure with
Mrs. Bolstreath. Then she rose and took Dan by the lapels of his coat, upon
which he promptly linked her to himself by placing both arms round her waist.
&quot;Dearest,&quot; she said earnestly, &quot;I shall marry you and you only. We have been
brought up more or less together, and we have always loved one another. Dad was
your guardian: you have three hundred a year of your own, and if we marry dad
can give us plenty, and----&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I know all that,&quot; interrupted Halliday, placing
her arms round his neck, &quot;and it is just because Sir Charles knows also, that he
will never consent to our marriage. I knew what was in the wind weeks ago,
darling heart, and every day I have been expecting what has occurred to-night.
For that reason, I have come here as often as possible and have arranged for you
and the dragon to go to the theatre to-night. But, believe me, Lillian, it will
be for the last time. To-morrow I shall receive a note saying that I am to stay
away from Lord Curberry's bride.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I'm not his bride and I never shall be,&quot;
stamped Lillian, and the tears came into her pretty eyes, whereupon Dan, as a
loyal lover, wiped them away with his pocket-handkerchief tenderly, &quot;and--and--&quot;
she faltered. &quot;And--and--&quot; he mocked, knowing her requirements, which led him to
console her with a long and lingering kiss. &quot;Oh!&quot; he sighed and Lillian,
nestling in his arms, echoed the sigh. The moment of perfect understanding and
perfect love held them until the sudden opening of the door placed Dan on one
side of the table and Lillian on the other. &quot;It won't do, my dears,&quot; said the
new-comer, who was none other than Mrs. Bolstreath, flaming with wrath, but not,
as the lovers found later, at them. &quot;I know quite well that Dan hasn't wasted
his time in this league-divided wooing.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;We thought that one of the
servants----&quot; began the young man, when Mrs. Bolstreath interrupted. &quot;Well, and
am I not one of the servants? Sir Charles has reminded me of the fact three
times with the information that I am not worth my salt, much less the good table
he keeps.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Oh! Bolly dear,&quot; and Lillian ran to the stout chaperon to embrace
her with many kisses, &quot;was dad nasty?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;He wasn't agreeable,&quot; assented Mrs.
Bolstreath, fanning herself with her handkerchief, for the interview had heated
her. &quot;You can't expect him to be, my sweet, when his daughter loves a pauper.&quot;
&quot;Thank you,&quot; murmured Dan bowing, &quot;but don't you think it is time we went to the
theatre, Bolly dear.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;You must not be so familiar, young man,&quot; said the
chaperon, broadly smiling at the dark handsome face. &quot;Sir Charles wants Lillian
to marry----&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Then I shan't!&quot; Lillian stamped again, &quot;I hate Lord Curberry.&quot;
&quot;And you love Dan!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Don't be so familiar, young woman,&quot; said Halliday, in a
joking way, &quot;unless you are on our side, that is.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;If I were not on your side,&quot;
rejoined Mrs. Bolstreath, majestically, &quot;I should be the very dragon Lillian
calls me. After all, Dan, you <i>are</i> poor.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Poor, but honest.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Worse and worse.
Honest people never grow rich. And then you have such a dangerous profession,
taking people flying trips in those aeroplanes. One never can be sure if you
will be home to supper. I'm sure Lillian would not care to marry a husband who
was uncertain about being home for supper.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I'll marry Dan,&quot; said Lillian, and
embraced Dan, who returned the embrace. &quot;Children! Children!&quot; Mrs. Bolstreath
raised her hands in horror, &quot;think of what you are doing. The servants may be in
at any moment. Come to the drawing-room and have coffee. The motor-car is
waiting and --hush, separate, separate,&quot; cried the chaperon, &quot;someone is
coming!&quot; She spoke truly, for the lovers had just time to fly asunder when Sir
Charles's secretary entered swiftly. He was a lean, tall, haggard-looking young
fellow of thirty with a pallid complexion and scanty light hair. A thin
moustache half concealed a weak mouth, and he blinked his eyes in a nervous
manner when he bowed to the ladies and excused his presence. &quot;Sir Charles left
his spectacles here,&quot; he said in a soft and rather unsteady voice, &quot;he sent me
for them and----&quot; he had glided to the other side of the table by this
time--&quot;oh, here they are. The motor-car waits, Miss Moon.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Where is my father?&quot;
asked Lillian irrelevantly. &quot;Tell me, Mr. Penn.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;In the library, Miss Moon,&quot;
said the secretary glibly, &quot;but he cannot see any one just now--not even you,
Miss Moon.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Why not?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;He is waiting to interview an official from Scotland
Yard--a Mr. Durwin on important business.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;You see,&quot; murmured Dan to Lillian in
an undertone, &quot;your father intends to lock me up for daring to love you.&quot; Miss
Moon took no notice. &quot;What is the business?&quot; she asked sharply. &quot;Indeed, I don't
know, Miss Moon. It is strictly private. Sir Charles has related nothing to me.
And if you will excuse me--if you don't mind--these spectacles are wanted
and----&quot; he babbled himself out of the room, while Mrs. Bolstreath turned on her
charge. &quot;You don't mean to say, you foolish child, that you were going to see
your father about 'this'!&quot; she indicated Halliday. &quot;I don't care about being
called a 'this'!&quot; said Dan, stiffly. Neither lady noticed the protest. &quot;I want
to make it clear to my father as soon as possible, that I shall marry Dan and no
one else,&quot; declared Lillian, pursing up her pretty mouth obstinately. &quot;Then take
him at the right moment,&quot; retorted Mrs. Bolstreath crossly, for the late
interview had tried even her amiable temper. &quot;Just now he is seething with
indignation that an aviator should dare to raise his eyes to you.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Aviators
generally look down,&quot; said Dan flippantly; &quot;am I to be allowed to take you and
Lillian to the theatre this evening?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yes. Although Sir Charles mentioned that
you would do better to spend your money on other things than mere frivolity.&quot;
&quot;Oh!&quot; said Halliday with a shrug, &quot;as to that, this particular frivolity is
costing me nothing. I got the box from Freddy Laurance, who is on that very
up-to-date newspaper <i>The Moment</i> as a reporter. I have dined at my future
father-in-law's expense, and now I go in his motor-car without paying for the
trip. I don't see that my pleasures could cost me less. Even Sir Charles must be
satisfied with such strict economy.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Sir Charles will be satisfied with nothing
save a promise for you to go away and leave Lillian alone,&quot; said Mrs.
Bolstreath, sadly, &quot;he has no feeling of romance such as makes me foolish enough
to encourage a pauper.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;You called me that before,&quot; said Dan, coolly, &quot;well,
there's no getting over facts. I am a pauper, but I love Lillian.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;And I--&quot;
began Lillian, advancing, only to be waved back and prevented from speaking
further by Mrs. Bolstreath. &quot;Don't make love before my very eyes,&quot; she said
crossly, &quot;after all I am paid to keep you two apart, and--and--well, there's no
time for coffee, so we had better finish the discussion in the car. There is
plenty of time between Hampstead and the Strand to allow of a long argument. And
remember, Dan,&quot; Mrs. Bolstreath turned at the door to shake her finger, &quot;this is
your last chance of uninterrupted conversation with Lillian.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Let us make honey
while the flowers bloom,&quot; whispered Halliday, poetically, and stole a final and
hasty kiss before he led the girl after the amiable dragon, who had already left
the room. The lovers found her talking to a poorly-dressed and rather stout
female clothed in rusty mourning, who looked the picture of decent but
respectable poverty. The entrance door stood open, and the waiting motor-car
could be seen at the steps, while the footman stood near Mrs. Bolstreath,
watching her chatting to the stranger and wearing an injured expression. It
seemed that the decent woman wished to see Sir Charles, and the footman had
refused her admission since his master was not to be disturbed. The woman--she
called herself Mrs. Brown and was extremely tearful--had therefore appealed to
the dragon, who was explaining that she could do nothing. &quot;Oh, but I am sure you
can get Sir Charles Moon to see me, my lady,&quot; wailed Mrs. Brown with a dingy
handkerchief to her red eyes, &quot;my son has been lost overboard off one of those
steamers Sir Charles owns, and I want to ask him to give me some money. My son
was my only support, and now I am starving.&quot; Lillian knew that her father owned
a number of tramp steamers, which picked up cargoes all over the world, and saw
no reason why the woman should not have the interview since her son had been
drowned while in Moon's service. The hour was certainly awkward, since Sir
Charles had an appointment before he went down to the House. But a starving
woman and a sorrowful woman required some consideration so she stepped forward
hastily and touched Mrs. Brown's rusty cloak. &quot;I shall ask my father to see
you,&quot; she said quickly, &quot;wait here!&quot; and without consulting Mrs. Bolstreath she
went impulsively to her father's study, while Mrs. Brown dabbed her eyes with
her handkerchief and called down blessings on her young head. Dan believed the
story of the lost son, but doubted the tale of starvation as Mrs. Brown looked
too stout to have been without food for any length of time. He looked hard at
her face, which was more wrinkled than a fat woman's should be; although such
lines might be ascribed to grief. She wept profusely and was so overcome with
sorrow that she let down a ragged veil when she saw Dan's eager gaze. The young
gentleman, she observed, could not understand a mother's feelings, or he would
not make a show of her by inquisitorial glances. The remark was somewhat
irrelevant, and the action of letting down the veil unnecessary, but much might
be pardoned to a woman so obviously afflicted. Dan was about to excuse his
inquiring looks, when Lillian danced back with the joyful information that her
father would see Mrs. Brown for a few minutes if she went in at once. &quot;And I
have asked him to help you,&quot; said the girl, patting the tearful woman's
shoulder, as she passed to the motor-car. &quot;Oh! it's past eight o'clock. Dan,
we'll never be in time.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;The musical comedy doesn't begin until nine,&quot; Halliday
assured her, and in a few minutes the three of them were comfortably seated in
the luxurious car, which whirled at break-neck speed towards the Strand. Of
course Lillian and Dan took every advantage of the opportunity, seeing that Mrs.
Bolstreath was sympathetic enough to close her eyes to their philanderings. They
talked all the way to the Curtain Theatre; they talked all through the musical
comedy; and talked all the way back to the house at Hampstead. Mrs. Bolstreath,
knowing that the young couple would not have another opportunity for
uninterrupted love-making, and being entirely in favor of the match, attended to
the stage and left them to whisper unreproved. She did not see why Dan, whom
Lillian had loved since the pair had played together as children, should be set
aside in favor of a dry-as-dust barrister, even though he had lately come into a
fortune and a title. &quot;But, of course,&quot; said Mrs. Bolstreath between the facts,
&quot;if you could only invent a perfect flying-machine, they would make you a duke
or something and give you a large income. Then you could marry.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;What are you
talking about, Bolly darling?&quot; asked Lillian, much puzzled, as she could not be
supposed to know what was going on inside her friend's head. &quot;About you and Dan,
dear. He has no money and----&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I shall make heaps and heaps of money,&quot; said
Dan, sturdily; &quot;aviation is full of paying possibilities, and the nation that
first obtains command of the air will rule the world. I'm no fool!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;You're a
commoner,&quot; snapped Mrs. Bolstreath quickly, &quot;and unless, as I said, you are made
a duke for inventing a perfect aeroplane, Lord Curberry is certainly a better
match for Lillian.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;He's as dull as tombs,&quot; said Miss Moon with her pretty nose
in the air. &quot;You can't expect to have everything, my dear child.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I can expect
to have Dan,&quot; retorted Lillian decidedly, whereat Dan whispered sweet words and
squeezed his darling's gloved hand. &quot;Well,&quot; said Mrs. Bolstreath, as the curtain
rose on the second act, &quot;I'll do my best to help you since I believe in young
love and true love. Hush, children, people are looking! Attend to the stage.&quot;
Dan and Lillian did their best to follow her advice and sat demurely in their
stalls side by side, watching the heroine flirt in a duet with the hero, both
giving vent to their feelings in a lively musical number. But they really took
little interest in &quot;The Happy Bachelor!&quot; as the piece was called, in spite of
the pretty girls and the charming music and the artistic dresses and the
picturesque scenery. They were together and that was all they cared about, and
although a dark cloud of parental opposition hovered over them, they were not
yet enveloped in its gloom. And after all, since Mrs. Bolstreath was strongly
prejudiced in their favor, Lillian hoped that she might induce Sir Charles to
change his mind as regards Lord Curberry. He loved his daughter dearly and would
not like to see her unhappy, as she certainly would be if compelled to marry any
one but Dan. Lillian said this to Mrs. Bolstreath and to Dan several times on
the way home, and they entirely agreed with her. &quot;Although I haven't much
influence with Sir Charles,&quot; Mrs. Bolstreath warned them, &quot;and he is fond of
having his own way.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;He always does what I ask,&quot; said Lillian confidently.
&quot;Why, although he was so busy this evening he saw Mrs. Brown when I pleaded for
her.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;He couldn't resist you,&quot; whispered Dan fondly, &quot;no one could.&quot; Mrs.
Bolstreath argued this point, saying that Lillian was Sir Charles's daughter,
and fathers could not be expected to feel like lovers. She also mentioned that
she was jeopardizing her situation by advocating the match, which was certainly
a bad one from a financial point of view, and would be turned out of doors as an
old romantic fool. The lovers assured her she was the most sensible of women and
that if she was turned out of doors they would take her in to the cottage where
they proposed to reside like two turtle doves. Then came laughter and kisses and
the feeling that the world was not such a bad place after all. It was a very
merry trio that alighted at the door of Moon's great Hampstead mansion. Then
came a shock, the worse for being wholly unexpected. At the door the three were
met by Marcus Penn, who was Moon's secretary. He looked leaner and more haggard
than ever, and his general attitude was that of the bearer of evil news. Dan and
Lillian and Mrs. Bolstreath stared at him in amazement. &quot;You may as well know
the worst at once, Miss Moon,&quot; said Penn, his lips quivering with nervousness,
&quot;your father is dead. He has been murdered.&quot;</p>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<h4>CHAPTER II</h4>
<h5><a name="div1_02" href="#div1Ref_02">A COMPLETE MYSTERY</a></h5>
<br>

<p>It was Mrs. Bolstreath who carried Lillian upstairs in her stout arms, for when
Penn made his brusque announcement the girl fainted straight away, which was
very natural considering the horror of the information. Dan remained behind to
tell the secretary that he was several kinds of fool, since no one but a
superfine ass would blurt out so terrible a story to a delicate girl. Not that
Penn had told his story, for Lillian had become unconscious the moment her
bewildered brain grasped that the father she had left a few hours earlier in
good health and spirits was now a corpse. But he told it to Dan, and mentioned
that Mr. Durwin was in the library wherein the death had taken place. &quot;Mr.
Durwin? Who is Mr. Durwin?&quot; asked Dan trying to collect his senses, which had
been scattered by the dreadful news. &quot;An official from Scotland Yard; I told you
so after dinner,&quot; said Penn in an injured tone, &quot;he came to see Sir Charles by
appointment at nine o'clock and found him a corpse.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Sir Charles was alive when
we left shortly after eight,&quot; remarked Dan sharply; &quot;at a quarter-past eight to
be precise. What took place in the meantime?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Obviously the violent death of
Sir Charles,&quot; faltered the secretary. &quot;What evidence have you to show that he
died by violence?&quot; asked Halliday. &quot;Mr. Durwin called in a doctor, and he says
that Sir Charles had been poisoned,&quot; blurted out Penn uneasily. &quot;I believe that
woman--Mrs. Brown she called herself--poisoned him. She left the house at a
quarter to nine, so the footman says, for he let her out, and----&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;It is
impossible that a complete stranger should poison Sir Charles,&quot; interrupted Dan
impatiently, &quot;she would not have the chance.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;She was alone with Sir Charles
for thirty minutes, more or less,&quot; said Penn tartly; &quot;she had every chance and
she took it.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;But how could she induce Sir Charles to drink poison?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;She
didn't induce him to drink anything. The doctor says that the scratch at the
back of the dead man's neck----&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Here!&quot; Dan roughly pushed the secretary aside,
becoming impatient of the scrappy way in which he detailed what had happened.
&quot;Let me go to the library for myself and see what has happened. Sir Charles
can't be dead.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;It's twelve o'clock now,&quot; retorted Penn stepping aside, &quot;and
he's been dead quite three hours, as the doctor will tell you.&quot; Before the man
finished his sentence, Dan, scarcely grasping the situation, so rapidly had it
evolved, ran through the hall, towards the back of the spacious house, where the
library was situated. He dashed into the large and luxuriously furnished room
and collided with a police officer, who promptly took him by the shoulder. There
were three other men in the room, who turned from the corpse at which they were
looking, when they heard the noise of Halliday's abrupt entrance. The foremost
man, and the one who spoke first, was short and stout and arrayed in uniform,
with cold gray eyes, and a hard mouth. &quot;What's this--what's this?&quot; he demanded
in a raucous voice. &quot;Who are you?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;My name is Halliday,&quot; said Dan hurriedly. &quot;I
am engaged to Miss Moon and we have just returned from the theatre to hear--to
hear----&quot; He caught sight of Moon's body seated in the desk-chair and drooping
limply over the table. &quot;Oh, it is true, then! He is dead. Good heavens! who
murdered him?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;How do you know that Sir Charles has been murdered?&quot; asked the
officer sternly. &quot;Mr. Penn, the secretary, told me just now in the hall,&quot; said
Dan, shaking himself free of the policeman. &quot;He blurted it out like a fool, and
Miss Moon has fainted. Mrs. Bolstreath has taken her upstairs. But how did it
come about? Who found the body, and----&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I found the body,&quot; interrupted one of
the other men, who was tall and calm-faced, with a bald head and a heavy
iron-gray moustache, perfectly clothed in fashionable evening-dress, and
somewhat imperious in his manner of speaking. &quot;I had an appointment with Sir
Charles at nine o'clock and came here to find him, as you now see him&quot;--he waved
his hand toward the desk--&quot;the doctor will tell you how he died.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;By poison,&quot;
said the third man, who was dark, young, unobtrusive and retiring in manner.
&quot;You see this deep scratch on the back of the neck. In that way the poison was
administered. I take it that Sir Charles was bending over his desk and the
person who committed the crime scratched him with some very sharp instrument
impregnated with poison.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Mrs. Brown!&quot; gasped Dan, staring at the heavy,
swollen body of his late guardian, whom he had dined with in perfect health. The
three men glanced at one another as he said the name, and even the policeman on
guard at the door looked interested. The individual in uniform spoke with his
cold eyes on Dan's agitated face. &quot;What do you know of Mrs. Brown, Mr.
Halliday?&quot; he demanded abruptly. &quot;Don't you know that a woman of that name
called here?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yes. The secretary, Mr. Penn, told us that Miss Moon induced her
father to see a certain Mrs. Brown, who claimed that her son had been drowned
while working on one of the steamers owned by Sir Charles. You saw her also, I
believe?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I was in the hall when Miss Moon went to induce her father to see the
poor woman. That was about a quarter-past eight o'clock.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;And Mrs. Brown--as we
have found from inquiry--left the house at a quarter to nine. Do you think she
is guilty?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I can't say. Didn't the footman see the body--that is if Mrs. Brown
committed the crime--when he came to show her out? Sir Charles would naturally
ring his bell when the interview was over, and the footman would come to conduct
her to the door.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Sir Charles never rang his bell!&quot; said the officer, drily.
&quot;Mrs. Brown passed through the entrance hall at a quarter to nine o'clock, and
mentioned to the footman--quite unnecessarily, I think--that Sir Charles had
given her money. He let her out of the house. Naturally, the footman not hearing
any bell did not enter this room, nor--so far as any one else is concerned--did
a single person. Only when Mr. Durwin----&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I came at nine o'clock,&quot; interrupted
the baldheaded man imperiously, &quot;to keep my appointment. The footman told Mr.
Penn, who took me to Sir Charles. He knocked but there was no answer, so he
opened the door and we saw this.&quot; He again waved his hands towards the body.
&quot;Does Mr. Penn know nothing?&quot; asked Halliday, doubtfully. &quot;No,&quot; answered the
other. &quot;Inspector Tenson has questioned him carefully in my presence. Mr. Penn
says that he brought Sir Charles his spectacles from the dining-room before you
left for the theatre with the two ladies, and then was sent to his own room by
his employer to write the usual letters. He remained there until nine o'clock
when he was called out to receive me, and we know that Mr. Penn speaks truly,
for the typewriting girl who was typing Sir Charles's letters to Mr. Penn's
dictation, says that he did not leave the room all the time. &quot;May I look at the
body?&quot; asked Dan approaching the desk, and, on receiving an affirmative reply
from Durwin, bent over the dead. The corpse was much swollen, the face indeed
being greatly bloated, while the deep scratch on the nape of the neck looked
venomous and angry. Yet it was a slight wound to bring about so great a
catastrophe, and the poison must have been very deadly and swift; deadly because
apparently Sir Charles had no time to move before it did its work, and swift
because he could not even have called for assistance, which he surely would have
done had he been able to keep his senses. Dan mentioned this to the watchful
doctor, who nodded. &quot;I can't say for certain,&quot; he remarked cautiously, &quot;but I
fancy that snake-poison has been used. That will be seen to, when the
post-mortem is made.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;And this fly?&quot; Halliday pointed to an insect which was
just behind the left ear of the dead man. &quot;Fly!&quot; echoed Inspector Tenson in
surprise, and hastily advancing to look. &quot;A fly in November. Impossible! Yet it
is a fly, and dead. If not,&quot; he swept the neck of the corpse with his curved
hand, &quot;it would get away. H'm! Now I wonder what this means? Get me a magnifying
glass.&quot; There was not much difficulty in procuring one, as such an article lay
on the desk itself, being used, no doubt, by Sir Charles to aid his failing
sight when he examined important documents. Tenson inspected the fly and removed
it--took it to a near electric light and examined it. Then he came back and
examined the place behind the left ear whence he had removed it. &quot;It's been
gummed on,&quot; he declared in surprise--a surprise which was also visible in the
faces of the other men; &quot;you can see the glistening spot on the skin, and the
fly's legs are sticky.&quot; He balanced the fly on his little finger as he spoke. &quot;I
am sure they are sticky, although it is hard to say with such a small insect.
However,&quot; he carefully put away the fly in a silver matchbox, &quot;we'll have this
examined under a more powerful glass. You are all witnesses, gentlemen, that a
fly was found near the wound which caused Sir Charles Moon's death.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;And the
scent? What about the scent?&quot; Dan sniffed as he spoke and then bent his nose to
the dead man. &quot;It seems to come from his clothes.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Scent!&quot; echoed Durwin
sharply and sniffed. &quot;Yes, I observed that scent. But I did not take any notice
of it.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Nor did I,&quot; said the doctor. &quot;I noticed it also.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;And I,&quot; followed on
the Inspector, &quot;and why should we take notice of it, Mr. Halliday? Many men use
scent.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Sir Charles never did,&quot; said Dan emphatically, &quot;he hated scents of all
kinds even when women used them. He certainly would never have used them
himself. I'll swear to that.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Then this scent assumes importance.&quot; Durwin
sniffed again, and held his aquiline nose high. &quot;It is fainter now. But I smelt
it very strongly when I first came in and looked at the body. A strange perfume
it is.&quot; The three men tried to realize the peculiar odor of the scent, and
became aware that it was rich and heavy and sickly, and somewhat drowsy in its
suggestion. &quot;A kind of thing to render a man sleepy,&quot; said Dan, musingly. &quot;Or
insensible,&quot; said Inspector Tenson hastily, and put his nose to the dead man's
chin and mouth. He shook his head as he straightened himself. &quot;I fancied from
your observation, Mr. Halliday, that the scent might have been used as a kind of
chloroform, but there's no smell about the face. It comes from the clothes,&quot; he
sniffed again, &quot;yes, it certainly comes from the clothes. Did you smell this
scent on Mrs. Brown?&quot; he demanded suddenly. &quot;No, I did not,&quot; admitted Halliday
promptly, &quot;otherwise I should certainly have noted it. I have a keen sense of
smell. Mrs. Bolstreath and Lil--I mean Miss Moon--might have noticed it,
however.&quot; At that moment, as if in answer to her name, the door opened suddenly
and Lillian brushed past the policeman in a headlong entrance into the library.
Her fair hair was in disorder, her face was bloodless, and her eyes were staring
and wild. Behind her came Mrs. Bolstreath hurriedly, evidently trying to
restrain her. But the girl would not be restrained, and rushed forward
scattering the small group round the dead, to fling herself on the body. &quot;Oh,
father, father!&quot; she sobbed, burying her face on the shoulder of her
dearly-loved parent. &quot;How awful it is. Oh, my heart will break. How shall I ever
get over it. Father! father! father!&quot; She wept and wailed so violently that the
four men were touched by her great grief. Both Mr. Durwin and Inspector Tenson
had daughters of their own, while the young doctor was engaged. They could feel
for her thoroughly, and no one made any attempt to remove her from the body
until Mrs. Bolstreath stepped forward. &quot;Lillian, darling. Lillian, my child,&quot;
she said soothingly, and tried to lead the poor girl away. But Lillian only
clung closer to her beloved dead. &quot;No! No! Let me alone. I can't leave him.
Poor, dear father--oh, I shall die!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Dear,&quot; said Mrs. Bolstreath, raising her
firmly but kindly, &quot;your father is not there but in Heaven! Only the clay
remains.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;It is all I have. And father was so good, so kind,--oh, who can have
killed him in this cruel way?&quot; She looked round with streaming eyes. &quot;We think
that a Mrs. Brown--&quot; began the Inspector, only to be answered by a loud cry from
the distraught girl. &quot;Mrs. Brown! Then I have killed father! I have killed him!
I persuaded him to see the woman, because she was in trouble. And she killed
him--oh, the wretch--the--the--oh--oh! What had I done to her that she should
rob me of my dear, kind father?&quot; and she cried bitterly in her old friend's
tender arms. &quot;Had you ever seen Mrs. Brown before?&quot; asked Durwin in his
imperious voice, although he lowered it in deference to her grief. Lillian
winced at the harsh sound. &quot;No, No! I never saw her before. How could I have
seen her before. She said that her son had been drowned, and that she was poor.
I asked father to help her, and he told me he would. It's my fault that she saw
my father and now&quot;--her voice leaped an octave--&quot;he's dead. Oh--oh! my
father--my father!&quot; and she tried to break from Mrs. Bolstreath's arms to fling
herself on the dead once more. &quot;Lillian darling, don't cry,&quot; said Dan, placing
his hand on her shoulder. &quot;You have not lost the dearest and best of fathers!&quot;
she sobbed violently. &quot;Your loss is my loss,&quot; said Halliday in a voice of pain,
&quot;but we must be brave, both you and I.&quot; He associated himself with her so as to
calm her grief. &quot;It's not your fault that your dear father is dead.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I
persuaded him to see Mrs. Brown. And she--she--she----&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;We can't say if this
woman is guilty, as yet,&quot; said Durwin hastily, &quot;so do not blame yourself, Miss
Moon. But did you smell any scent on this Mrs. Brown?&quot; Lillian looked at him
vacantly and shook her head. Then she burst once more into hard and painful
sobbing, trying again to embrace the dead man. &quot;Don't ask her any questions,
sir,&quot; said Halliday, in a low voice to Mr. Durwin, &quot;you see she is not in a fit
state to reply. Lillian,&quot; he raised her up from her knees and gently but firmly
detached her arms from the dead. &quot;My darling, your father is past all earthly
aid. We can do nothing but avenge him. Go with Mrs. Bolstreath and lie down. We
must be firm.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Firm! Firm!--and father dead!&quot; wailed Lillian. &quot;Oh, what a
wretch that Mrs. Brown must be to kill him. Kill her, Dan--oh, make her suffer.
My good, kind father, who--who--oh&quot;--she flung herself on Dan's neck--&quot;take me
away; take me away!&quot; and her lover promptly carried her to the door. Mrs.
Bolstreath, who had been talking hurriedly to Inspector Tenson, came after the
pair and took the girl from Dan. &quot;She must lie down and have a
sleeping-draught,&quot; she said softly. &quot;If the doctor will come----&quot; The doctor was
only too glad to come. He was a young man beginning to practise medicine in the
neighborhood, and had been hurriedly summoned in default of an older physician.
The chance of gaining a new and wealthy patient was too good to lose, so he
quickly followed Mrs. Bolstreath as she led the half-unconscious girl up the
stairs. Dan closed the door and returned to the Inspector and the official from
Scotland Yard. The former was speaking. &quot;Mrs. Bolstreath did not smell any
perfume on Mrs. Brown,&quot; he was saying, &quot;and ladies are very quick to notice such
things. Miss Moon also shook her head.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I don't think Miss Moon was in a state
of mind to understand what you were saying, Mr. Inspector,&quot; said Halliday,
drily. &quot;However, I am quite sure from my own observation that Mrs. Brown did not
use the perfume. I would have noticed it at once, for I spotted it the moment I
examined the body.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;So did I,&quot; said Durwin once more; &quot;but I thought Sir
Charles might have used it. You say he did not, therefore the scent is a clue.&quot;
&quot;It does not lead to the indictment of Mrs. Brown, however, sir,&quot; said Tenson
thoughtfully, &quot;since she had no perfume of that sort about her. But she must
have killed Sir Charles, for she was the last person who saw him alive.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;She
may come forward and exonerate herself,&quot; suggested Dan after a pause, &quot;or she
may have left her address with Sir Charles.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I have glanced through the papers
on the desk and can find no address,&quot; was the Inspector's reply; &quot;yet, if she
gave it to him, it would be there.&quot; Durwin meditated, then looked up. &quot;As she
was the mother of the man in Sir Charles's employment who was drowned,&quot; he said
in his harsh voice, and now very official in his manner, &quot;in the offices of the
company who own the steamers--Sir Charles was a director and chief shareholder,
I understand from his secretary, Mr. Penn--will be found the drowned man's
address, which will be that of his mother.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;But I can't see what motive Mrs.
Brown had to murder Sir Charles,&quot; remarked Dan in a puzzled tone. &quot;We'll learn
the motive when we find Mrs. Brown,&quot; said Tenson, who had made a note of
Durwin's suggestion. &quot;Many people think they have grievances against the rich,
and we know that the late Sir Charles was a millionaire. He doubtless had
enemies--dangerous enemies.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Dangerous!&quot; The word recalled to Dan what Moon had
said at the dinner-table when Lillian had playfully offered him a penny for his
thoughts. &quot;Sir Charles at dinner said something about dangerous people.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;What
did he say?&quot; asked the Inspector and again opened his note-book. Dan reported
the conversation, which was not very satisfactory as Moon had only spoken
generally. Tenson noted down the few remarks, but did not appear to think them
important. Durwin, however, was struck by what had been said. &quot;Sir Charles asked
me here to explain about a certain gang he believed was in existence,&quot; he
remarked. &quot;What's that, sir?&quot; asked the Inspector alertly. &quot;Did he tell you
anything?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Of course he didn't. How could he when he was dead when I arrived,&quot;
retorted Durwin with a frown. &quot;He simply said that he wished to see me in my
official capacity about some gang, but gave me no details. Those were to be left
until I called here. He preferred to see me here instead of at my office for
reasons which he declared he would state when we met in this room.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Then you
think that a gang----&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Mr. Inspector,&quot; interrupted Durwin, stiffly, &quot;I have
told you all that was said by the deceased. Whether the gang is dangerous, or
what the members do, or where they are, I cannot say. Have you examined those
windows?&quot; he asked suddenly, pointing to three French-windows at the side of the
room. &quot;Yes,&quot; said Tenson promptly, &quot;as soon as I entered the apartment I did so.
They are all locked.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;And if they were not, no one would enter there,&quot; put in
Dan quickly. &quot;Outside is a walled garden, and the wall is very high with broken
bottles on top. I suppose, Mr. Durwin, you are thinking that some one may have
come in to kill Sir Charles between the time of Mrs. Brown's departure and your
coming?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yes,&quot; assented the other sharply, &quot;if the perfume is a clue, Mrs.
Brown must be innocent. Penn, as we know from the statement of the typewriter
girl, was in his room all the time, and the servants have fully accounted for
themselves. We examined them all--the Inspector and I did, that is--when you
were at the theatre,&quot; he waved his hand with a shrug. &quot;Who can say who is
guilty?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Well,&quot; said Tenson, snapping the elastic band round his note-book and
putting it into his pocket, &quot;we have the evidence of the fly and of the
perfume.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;What do you think about the fly?&quot; asked Dan, staring. &quot;I don't know
what to think. It is an artificial fly, exquisitely made and has been gummed on
the dead man's neck behind the left ear. The assassin must have placed it there,
since a man would scarcely do such a silly thing himself. Why, it was placed
there I can't say, any more than I can guess why Sir Charles was murdered, or
who murdered him. The affair is a complete mystery, as you must admit.&quot; Before
the inquest and after the inquest, more people than the three men who had held
the discussion in the presence of the dead, admitted that the affair was a
mystery. In fact the evidence at the inquest only plunged the matter into deeper
gloom. Tenson, acting on Durwin's advice, sought the office of the tramp-steamer
company--The Universal Carrier Line--in which the late Sir Charles was chief
shareholder and director, to learn without any difficulty the whereabouts of
Mrs. Brown, the mother of the drowned man. She proved to be an entirely
different person to the woman who had given the name on the fatal night, being
lean instead of stout, comparatively young instead of old, and rather handsome
in an elderly way in place of being wrinkled and worn with grief. She declared
that she had never been near Moon's house on the night of the murder, or on any
other night. Mrs. Bolstreath, Lillian, the footman, and Dan all swore that she
was not the Mrs. Brown who had sought the interview with Sir Charles. Therefore
it was argued by every one that Mrs. Brown, taking a false name and telling a
false story, must have come to see Moon with the deliberate intention of
murdering him. Search was made for her, but she could not be found. From the
moment she passed out of the front door she had vanished, and although a
description was published of her appearance, and a reward was offered for her
apprehension no one came forward to claim it. Guilty or innocent, she was
invisible. Inspector Tenson did not speak at the inquest of the gang about which
Sir Charles had intended to converse with Mr. Durwin, as it did not seem to have
any bearing on the case. Also, as Durwin suggested, if it had any bearing it was
best to keep the matter quiet until more evidence was forthcoming to show that
such a gang--whatever its business was--existed. Then the strange episode of the
fly was suppressed for the same reason. Privately, Tenson informed Dan that he
would not be surprised to learn that there was a gang of murderers in existence
whose sign-manual was a fly, real or artificial, and instanced another gang,
which had been broken up some years previously, who always impressed the figure
of a purple fern on their victim. But the whole idea, said Tenson, was so vague
that he thought it best to suppress the fact of the artificial fly on the dead
man's neck. &quot;If there's anything in it,&quot; finished the Inspector, &quot;there's sure
to be other murders committed, and the fly placed on the victim. We'll wait and
see, and if a second case occurs we'll be sure that such a gang exists and will
collar the beasts. Best to say nothing, Mr. Halliday.&quot; So he said nothing, and
Dan said nothing, and Durwin, who approved of the necessary secrecy, held his
tongue. Of course there was a lot of talk and many theories as to who had
murdered the millionaire, and why he had been murdered in so ingenious a manner.
The postmortem examination proved that Moon had died of snake-poison
administered through the scratch on the neck, and the circumstantial evidence at
the inquest went to show that he must have been taken unawares, while bending
over his desk. Some people thought that Mrs. Brown was innocent because of the
absence of the perfume; others declared she must be guilty on account of her
false name and false story, and the fact that Moon was found dead a quarter of
an hour after she left the house. No doubt the circumstantial evidence was very
strong, but it could not be said positively that the woman was guilty, even
though she did not appear to defend her character. So the jury thought, for they
brought in the only possible verdict twelve good and lawful men could bring in:
&quot;Wilful murder against some person or persons unknown,&quot; and there the matter
ended for sheer want of further evidence. The affair was a mystery and a mystery
it remained. &quot;And will until the Day of Judgment!&quot; said Tenson, finally.</p>

<h4>CHAPTER III</h4>

<h5><a name="div1_03" href="#div1Ref_03">DUTY BEFORE PLEASURE</a></h5>
<br>

<p>The year ended sadly for Lillian, since she had lost
her father, her lover, and her home; gaining instead the doubtful companionship
of a paternal uncle, who stepped into the position of guardian. The girl,
although she did not know it at the time, was leaving a pleasant flowery lane to
turn into a flinty high road, arched by a dismal sky. It is true that she still
possessed Mrs. Bolstreath to comfort her, but the loss of Dan could scarcely be
compensated by the attentions of the chaperon. Not that Halliday was altogether
lost; but he had been pushed out of her life by Sir John Moon, who approved as
little of this suitor as the late baronet had done. &quot;You see, my dear child,&quot; he
exclaimed to Lillian, immediately after the New Year and when things were more
restful, &quot;as your guardian and uncle, I have to see that you make a good match.&quot;
&quot;What is marriage without love?&quot; queried Miss Moon scornfully. &quot;Love!&quot; Sir John
shrugged his elegant shoulders and sneered. &quot;Love is all very well, but a title
is better. I say nothing about money, as you have any amount of that useful
article. Now, Lord Curberry----&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I detest Lord Curberry, and I shan't marry
Lord Curberry,&quot; interrupted Lillian, frowning, and her mind held a picture of
the lean, ascetic peer with the cruel, grey eyes. As a barrister, Curberry was
no doubt admirable; as a nobleman, he filled his new position very well; but she
could not see him as a lover, try as she might. Not that she did try, for under
no conditions and under no pressure did she intend to become his wife. &quot;Your
father wished you to marry Lord Curberry,&quot; hinted Uncle John softly. &quot;My father
wished me to be happy,&quot; cried Lillian hotly, &quot;and I can't be happy unless I
marry Dan.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;That aviator man! Pooh! He has nothing to give you.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;He gives
himself, and that is all I want.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I see. Love in a cottage and----&quot; Lillian
interrupted again. &quot;There's no need for love in a cottage. I have plenty of
money; you said as much yourself, Uncle John.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;My dear,&quot; said the new baronet
gravely, &quot;from what I saw of young Halliday he is too proud a man to live on his
wife. And you would not respect him if he did. I think better of you than that,
my child.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Dan has his profession.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;H'm! And a dangerous one at that. Besides,
he doesn't make much money.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;He will though. Dan is a genius; he has all kinds
of ideas about flying machines, and some day he will conquer the air.&quot;
&quot;Meantime, you will be growing old waiting for him.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Not at all,&quot; Lillian
assured him. &quot;I shall be with him, helping all I can.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;You won't with my
consent,&quot; cried her uncle, heatedly. &quot;Then I shall do without your consent. I
shan't give up Dan.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;In that case,&quot; sighed Sir John, rising to show that the
interview was ended--and certainly it had ended in a clash of wills--&quot;there is
nothing for me to do but to make young Halliday give you up.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;He'll never do
that,&quot; said Miss Moon, pausing at the door with a fluttering heart, for her
uncle spoke very decidedly. &quot;Oh, I think so,&quot; replied Moon, with the air of a
man sure of his ground. &quot;He has, I am sure, some notion of honor.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;It isn't
honorable to give up a woman.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;It isn't honorable to live on a woman.&quot; The two
antagonists glared at one another, and a silence ensued. Neither would give way,
and neither would compromise in any way. Lillian wanted Dan as her husband, a
post Sir John did not intend the young man to fill. But he saw plainly enough
that harsh measures would drive Lillian to desperation, and he did not yet know
sufficient of Halliday to be sure that he would not grasp at a rich wife. Sir
John believed that men were like himself, and would do anything--honorable, or,
at a pinch, dishonorable--to secure a life of ease and comfort. However, as he
swiftly reflected, Halliday was young, and probably would be wax in the hands of
a clever man, such as Moon considered himself to be. It would be best to see him
and control the boy's mind by appealing to his decency--so Sir John put it.
&quot;Very good, my dear,&quot; he said, when he reached this point, &quot;matters are at a
dead-lock between us. I suggest that you let me interview Halliday.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I don't
mind, so long as I see him first,&quot; pouted the girl, mutinously. Sir John smiled
drily. &quot;So as to arm him for the fray. Very well. I consent, my dear. You can
arrange your campaign, and then I can discuss the matter with this very
undesirable suitor. But you must give me your promise that you will not run away
with him meanwhile?&quot; Lillian held herself very erect and replied stiffly. &quot;Of
course I promise, Uncle John. I am not ashamed of loving Dan, and I shall marry
him in a proper manner. But I shan't marry Lord Curberry,&quot; she ended, and fairly
ran away, so as to prevent further objections. &quot;Oh, my dear, I think you will,&quot;
grinned Sir John at the closed door, and he sat down to pen a diplomatic letter
to Mr. Halliday, as he wished to have the matter settled and done with. &quot;These
romantic young nuisances,&quot; said the schemer crossly. The new baronet was a slim,
well-preserved dandy of sixty, who looked no older than forty-five owing to the
means he took to keep himself fit. He was the younger and only brother of Moon,
and inherited the title since there was no nephew to take it. He also inherited
ten thousand a year for life on condition that he acted as Lillian's guardian.
It was no mean task, for the girl had an income of 50,000 coming in every
twelve months. There would be plenty of hard-up flies gathering round this
honey-pot, and Sir John foresaw that it would not be an easy business to settle
the young lady's matrimonial future, especially as the said young lady was
obstinate beyond belief. Sir John, being a loafer by nature, had never possessed
sufficient money to indulge to the full in his luxurious tastes, since his
brother had not financed him as largely as he could have wished. But now that he
was safe for the rest of his life on an income which would enable him to enjoy
the world's goods, Sir John did not wish to be bothered. It was his aim to get
his niece married and settled as soon as possible, so that she would be looked
after by a husband. Under these circumstances, and since Lillian was anxious to
marry Dan, it was strange that the baronet did not allow her to indulge her
fancy. He did not for two reasons: one was that he really did not think Halliday
a good match; and, moreover, knew of his late brother's opinion on the matter of
the wooing. The second reason had to do with the fact that he had borrowed a
large sum of money from Lord Curberry, and did not wish to pay it back again,
even though he could do so easily enough in his present flourishing
circumstances. Curberry offered to forego the payment if Sir John could persuade
Lillian to marry him. And as Moon wanted to be able to talk about the girl as a
peeress, and did not want to reduce his new income by frittering it away in
paying back debts, he was determined to bring about the very desirable marriage,
as he truly considered it to be. &quot;Curberry is sure to go in for politics,&quot;
thought the plotter, &quot;and he has enough brains to become Prime Minister if he
likes. He's got a decent income, too, and a very old title. With Lillian's money
and beauty she should have a titled husband. Besides,&quot; this was an
after-thought, &quot;Curberry can make himself deuced disagreeable if he likes.&quot; And
perhaps it was this last idea which made Sir John so anxious for the marriage to
take place. The late Sir Charles had been a big, burly, broad-shouldered man,
with a powerful clean-shaven face--the kind of overbearing, pushing personality
which was bound to come up on top wherever men were congregated. And Sir Charles
had massively pushed his way from poverty to affluence, from obscurity into
notoriety, if not fame. Now his honors and wealth were in the hands of two
people infinitely weaker than he had been. Lillian was but a delicate girl,
solely bent upon marriage with an undesirable suitor, while Sir John had no
desire to do anything with his new income and new title save to enjoy the goods
which the gods had sent him so unexpectedly. He was by no means a strong man,
being finical, self-indulgent, and quite feminine in his love for dress and
luxury. Much smaller and slighter than his masterful brother, he was perfectly
arrayed on all occasions in purple and fine linen; very self-possessed, very
polite, and invariably quiet in his manner. He had several small talents, and
indulged in painting, poetry, and music, producing specimens of each as weak and
neatly finished as himself. He also collected china and stamps, old lace and
jewels, which he loved for their color and glitter. Such a man was too
fantastical to earn the respect of Lillian, who adored the strength, which
showed itself in Dan. Consequently, she felt certain that she would be able to
force him to consent to her desires. But in this, the girl, inexperienced in
worldly matters and in human nature, reckoned without knowledge of Sir John's
obstinacy, which was a singularly striking trait of the man's character. Like
most weak people the new baronet loved to domineer, and, moreover, when his ease
was at stake, he could be strong even to cruelty, since fear begets that quality
as much as it fosters cowardice. Moon had removed Lillian and Mrs. Bolstreath to
his new house in Mayfair, because it was not wise that the girl should remain at
Hampstead, where everything served to remind her of the good father she had
lost. Therefore, Sir John wished for no trouble to take place under his roof, as
such--as he put it--would shatter his nerves. The mere fact that Lillian wished
to marry young Halliday, and that Curberry wished to marry her, was a fruitful
source of ills. It stands to Sir John's credit that he did not take the easiest
method of getting rid of his niece by allowing her to become Mrs. Halliday. He
had a conscience of some sort, and wished to carry out his late brother's desire
that Lillian should become a peeress. So far as the girl's inclinations were
concerned he cared little, since he looked upon her as a child who required
guidance. And to guide her in the proper direction--that is, towards the altar
in Curberry's company--Sir John put himself to considerable inconvenience, and
acted honestly with the very best intentions. His egotism--the powerful egotism
of a weak man--prevented him from seeing that Lillian was also a human being,
and had her right to freedom of choice. It must be said that, for a dilettante,
Sir John acted with surprising promptitude. He took the two women to his own
house, and let the mansion at Hampstead to an Australian millionaire, who paid
an excellent rent. Then he saw the lawyers, and went into details concerning the
property. Luckily, Sir Charles had gradually withdrawn from business a few years
before his death, since he had more or less concentrated his mind on politics.
Therefore, the income was mostly well invested, and, with the exception of the
line of steamers with which Mrs. Brown's son had been concerned, there were few
interests which required personal supervision. Sir John, having power under the
will, sold the dead man's interest in the ships, withdrew from several other
speculations, and having seen that the securities, which meant fifty thousand a
year to Lillian, and ten thousand a year to himself, were all in good order, he
settled down to enjoy himself. The lawyers--on whom he kept an eye--received the
money and banked it, and consulted with Sir John regarding reinvestments. They
also, by the new baronet's direction, offered a reward of 1,000 for the
discovery of the murderess. So, shortly after the New Year everything was more
or less settled, and Sir John found himself able to attend once more to his lace
and jewels, his music and poetry. Only Lillian's marriage remained to be
arranged, and after his conversation with the girl, Sir John appointed a day for
Dan to call. That young gentleman, who had been hovering round, lost no time in
obeying the summons, which was worded amiably enough, and presented himself in
due time. Sir John received Halliday with great affability, offered him a chair
and a cigarette, and came to the point at once. &quot;It's about Lillian I wish to
see you, Mr. Halliday,&quot; he remarked, placing the tips of his fingers delicately
together. &quot;You can go up to the drawing-room afterwards and have tea with her
and with Mrs. Bolstreath. But we must have a chat first to adjust the
situation.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;What situation?&quot; asked Dan, wilfully dense. &quot;Oh, I think you
understand,&quot; rejoined Sir John, drily. &quot;Well?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I love her,&quot; was all that Dan
could find to say. &quot;Naturally. Lillian is a charming girl, and you are a young
man of discernment. At least, I hope so, as I wish you to give Lillian up.&quot; Dan
rose and pitched his cigarette into the fire. &quot;Never,&quot; he cried, looking pale
and determined and singularly virile and handsome. &quot;How can you ask such a
thing, Mr. Moon--I mean Sir John.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;My new title doesn't come easily I see,&quot;
said the baronet smoothly. &quot;Oh, I quite understand. My poor brother died so
unexpectedly that none of us have got used to the new order of things. You least
of all, Mr. Halliday.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Why not 'Dan'?&quot; asked that young gentleman, leaning
against the mantelpiece since he felt that he could talk better standing than
sitting. &quot;Because, as I say, there is a new order of things. I have known you
all your life, my dear boy, as your parents placed you in my late brother's
charge when you were only five years of age. But I say Mr. Halliday instead of
Dan as I wish you to understand that we are talking as business men and not as
old friends.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;You take away your friendship----&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Not at all, Mr. Halliday. We
shall be better friends than ever when we have had our talk and you have done
the right thing. Probably I shall then call you Dan, as of yore.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;You can call
me what you please,&quot; said Dan obstinately, and rather angrily, for the fiddling
methods of Sir John annoyed him. &quot;But I won't give up the dearest girl in the
world.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Her father wished her to marry Lord Curberry.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;If her father had
lived, bless him,&quot; retorted Halliday vehemently, &quot;he would have seen that
Lillian loves me, and not Curberry, in which case he would not have withheld his
consent.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Oh, I think he would,&quot; said Sir John amiably. &quot;Lillian is rich, and
my poor brother wished to obtain a title for her. Very natural, Mr. Halliday, as
you must see for yourself. Charles always aimed at high things.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;He loved
Lillian and would not have seen her unhappy,&quot; said Dan bluffly. &quot;I don't see
that Curberry would make her unhappy. He is devoted to her.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;But she does not
love him,&quot; argued Halliday crossly, &quot;and how can there be happiness when love is
lacking. Come, Sir John, you have, as you said just now, known me all my life. I
am honorable and clean-living and wellborn, while Lillian loves me. What
objection have you to the match?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;The same objection as my brother had, Mr.
Halliday. Lillian is wealthy and you are poor.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I have only a few hundreds a
year, it is true, but----&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;No 'buts' if you please,&quot; Sir John flung up a
delicate hand in protest. &quot;You can't argue away facts. If you marry Lillian, you
will live on her.&quot; Dan bit his lip and clenched his hands to prevent his temper
from showing itself too strongly. &quot;If another man had said that to me, Sir John,
I should have knocked him down.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Brute force is no argument,&quot; rejoined Moon
unruffled. &quot;Consider, Mr. Halliday, you have a few hundreds a year and Lillian
has fifty thousand coming in every twelve months. Being wealthy, she can
scarcely live on your income, so to keep up the position to which she has been
born, she must live on her own. Husband and wife are one, as we are assured by
the Church, therefore if she lives on the fifty thousand per annum, you must
live on it also.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I wouldn't take a single penny!&quot; cried Dan hotly and
boyishly. &quot;Oh, I am not suggesting that you would,&quot; said Sir John easily, &quot;but
Lillian cannot live in the cottage your few hundreds would run to, and if she
lives, as she must, being rich, in a large house, you must live there also, and
in a style which your income does not warrant. You know what people will say
under the circumstances. Either you must take Lillian to live on your small
income, which is not fair to her, or you must live on her large one, which is
not fair to you. I speak to a man of honor, remember.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;These arguments are
sophistical.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Not at all. You can't escape from facts.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Then is this miserable
money to stand between us?&quot; asked Dan in despair, for he could not deny that
there was great truth in what Sir John said. The baronet shrugged his shoulders.
&quot;It seems likely unless you can make a fortune equal to Lillian's.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Why not?
Aviation is yet in its infancy.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Quite so, and thus accidents are continually
happening. If you marry my niece, it is probable that you will shortly leave her
a widow. No! No! In whatever way you look at the matter, Mr. Halliday, the match
is most undesirable. Be a man--a man of honor--and give Lillian up.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;To be
miserable with Lord Curberry,&quot; said Dan fiercely, &quot;never!&quot; And he meant what he
said, as Sir John saw very plainly. This being the case the baronet used another
argument to obtain what he wanted. &quot;I have been young myself, and I know how you
feel,&quot; he said quietly. &quot;Very good. I suggest a compromise.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;What is it?&quot;
muttered Dan dropping into his chair again and looking very miserable, as was
natural, seeing what he stood to lose. &quot;My poor brother,&quot; went on Sir John
smoothly, and crossing his legs, &quot;has been struck down when most enjoying life.
The person who murdered him--presumably the woman who called herself Mrs.
Brown--has not yet been discovered in spite of the efforts of the police backed
by a substantial reward. I propose, Mr. Halliday, that you search for this
person, the period of searching be limited to one year. If you find her and she
is punished, then you shall marry Lillian; if you fail, then you must stand
aside and allow her to marry Lord Curberry.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;You forget,&quot; said Dan, not jumping
at the chance as Sir John expected, &quot;if I do bring the woman to justice, your
arguments regarding my living on Lillian remain in full force.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Oh, as to that,
Mr. Halliday, when the time comes, I can find arguments equally strong on the
other side. To use one now, if you revenge my brother's death, no one will deny
but what you have every right to marry his daughter and enjoy her income. That
would be only fair. Well?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Well,&quot; echoed Dan dully, and reflected with his sad
eyes on the carpet. Then he looked up anxiously. &quot;Meanwhile, Lillian may marry
Lord Curberry.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Oh,&quot; said Sir John, coolly, &quot;if you can't trust her----&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;He
can trust her,&quot; cried the voice of the girl, herself, and the curtain of the
folding doors was drawn quickly aside. &quot;Lillian!&quot; cried Dan, springing to his
feet and opening his arms. Sir John saw his niece rush into those same arms and
laughed. &quot;H'm!&quot; said he whimsically, &quot;I quite forgot that the folding-doors into
the next room were open. You have been listening.&quot; Lillian twisted herself in
Dan's arms, but did not leave them, as she felt safe within that warm embrace.
&quot;Of course I have been listening,&quot; she cried scornfully; &quot;as soon as I knew Dan
was in the house, and in the library, I listened. I told Bolly that I was coming
down to listen, and though she tried to prevent me, I came. Who has a better
right to listen when all the conversation was about me, and remember I should
have seen him first.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Well,&quot; said her uncle unmoved, &quot;it's no use arguing with
you. A man's idea of honor and a woman's are quite opposed to one another. You
heard. What have you to say?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I think you're horrid,&quot; snapped Lillian, in a
schoolgirl manner, &quot;as if my money mattered. I am quite willing to give it to
you and marry Dan on what he has. It's better to love in a garret than to hate
in a drawing-room.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Quite epigrammatic,&quot; murmured Sir John cynically. &quot;Well, my
dear, I am much obliged to you for your fifty thousand a year offer, but I fancy
what I have is enough for me. I never did care for millions, and always wondered
why my late brother should wear himself out in obtaining them. I decline.&quot;
&quot;Whether you decline or not, I marry Dan,&quot; said Lillian hotly. &quot;What does Dan
say?&quot; The young man disengaged himself. He had kept silent during the passage of
arms between uncle and niece. &quot;I say that I can trust Lillian to remain true to
me for twelve months.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;For ever, for ever, for ever!&quot; cried the girl, her face
flaming and her eyes flashing; &quot;but don't make any promise of letting our
marriage depend upon finding the woman who murdered my poor father.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Ah,&quot; said
Sir John contemptuously, &quot;you never loved your father, I see.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;How dare you say
that?&quot; flashed out the girl, panting with anger. &quot;My dear, ask yourself,&quot;
replied Moon patiently; &quot;your father has been basely murdered. Yet you do not
wish to avenge his death and prefer your own happiness to the fulfilment of a
solemn duty. Of course,&quot; added Sir John, with a shrug, for he now knew what line
of argument to take, &quot;you can't trust yourself to be faithful for twelve months
and----&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I <i>can</i> trust myself to be faithful, and for twelve centuries, if
necessary.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;No, no, no!&quot; smiled Moon, shaking his head, &quot;you prefer pleasure to
duty. I see you love yourself more than you loved your father. Well,&quot; he rose
and waved his hands with a gesture of dismissal, &quot;go your ways, my dear, and
marry Dan--you observe I call you 'Dan,' Mr. Halliday, since you are to become
my nephew straight away. When is the wedding to be?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;You consent?&quot; cried
Lillian opening her eyes widely. &quot;I can't stop you,&quot; said Moon, still continuing
his crafty diplomacy. &quot;You will soon be of age and you can buy your husband at
once, since you dare not risk a probation of twelve months.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I can risk twelve
years,&quot; retorted Lillian uneasily, for in a flash she understood how selfishly
she was behaving, seeing that her father's assassin was still at large, &quot;and to
prove it----&quot; she looked at Dan. He understood and spoke, although he had
already made up his mind as to the best course to pursue. &quot;To prove it,&quot; he said
steadily, &quot;we accept your proposal, Sir John. Lillian will wait twelve months,
and during that time I shall search for the woman who murdered Sir Charles. If I
don't find her----&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Lillian marries Lord Curberry,&quot; said Moon quickly. &quot;No,&quot;
cried the girl defiantly; &quot;that part of the agreement I decline to assent to.
Twelve months or twelve years it may take before the truth comes to light, but I
marry no one but Dan.&quot; Sir John reflected on the dangers of aviation and swiftly
came to a conclusion. &quot;We'll see at the end of the year,&quot; he said cautiously,
&quot;much may happen in that time.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;So long as Lillian's wedding to Curberry
doesn't happen,&quot; said Dan obstinately, &quot;I don't care. But it is understood that
Lillian is not to be worried about the matter?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;That depends upon what you and
Lillian call worry,&quot; said Moon drily, &quot;so far as I am concerned I shall not
coerce her in any way. All I wish is the promise of you both that you will wait
twelve months before taking any steps to marry. Meantime, you must not see too
much of Lillian.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Oh,&quot; cried the girl, indignantly, &quot;you would push Dan out of
my life.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;It's a test,&quot; explained Sir John, blinking nervously. &quot;You will be in
mourning for the next twelve months, and should see few people.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Of whom Dan
will be one,&quot; she flashed out. &quot;Occasionally--very occasionally, you can see
him, but, of course, if you can't trust yourself to be true without being
continually reminded that Mr. Halliday exists, there is no more to be said.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I
can trust myself,&quot; muttered the girl uneasily. &quot;And I can trust Lillian,&quot; said
Dan, promptly and decisively. &quot;It does not look like it since you always wish to
see one another. And remember, Lillian, you owe it to your father's memory to
put all thoughts of love, which is self, out of your heart until the mystery of
his death is entirely solved.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;There is something in that,&quot; said Halliday
thoughtfully and Lillian nodded; &quot;but of course I can write to Lillian.&quot;
&quot;Occasionally,&quot; said the baronet again, &quot;you must both be tested by a year's
separation, with a meeting or a letter every now and then. Duty must be the
keynote of the twelve months and not pleasure. Well?&quot; The lovers looked at one
another and sighed. The terms were hard, but not so hard as Sir John might have
made them. Still both the boy and the girl--they were little else--recognized
that their duty was to the dead. Afterwards pleasure would be theirs. Silently
they accepted and silently adjusted the situation. &quot;We agree!&quot; said the two
almost simultaneously. &quot;Very good,&quot; said Moon, rubbing his hands, &quot;how do you
intend to begin your search for the missing woman, Mr. Halliday?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I don't
know,&quot; murmured Dan, miserably. &quot;Neither do I,&quot; rejoined Sir John with great
amiability. &quot;Come to tea?&quot; And to tea the lovers went as to a funeral feast. But
Sir John rejoiced.</p>

<h4>CHAPTER IV</h4>

<h5><a name="div1_04" href="#div1Ref_04">AN AMATEUR DETECTIVE</a></h5>
<br>

<p>Dan left the Mayfair house
very mournfully, feeling that Sir John was indeed master of the situation. By a
skilful appeal to the generous emotions of youth, to the boy's honor and to the
girl's affections, he had procured a respite of twelve months, during which time
the lovers could do nothing, bound as they were by silken threads. This would
give Curberry time to push his suit, and there was always a chance that Dan
would come to grief in one of his aerial trips in which case Lillian would
certainly be driven to marry her titled swain. Halliday knew nothing of Moon's
reckoning on these points, or he would have only accepted the situation on
condition that Curberry was not to meet the girl or write to the girl oftener
than himself. Logically speaking, the peer and the commoner should have been
placed on the same footing. But Dan's grief at the parting confused his
understanding, and he had not been clever enough to seize his opportunity.
Therefore Sir John, winning all along the line, had cleared the path for
Curberry, and had more or less blocked it for Dan. But, as yet, the young man
did not grasp the full extent of Sir John's worldly wisdom. What Halliday had to
do--and this dominated his mind immediately he left the house--was to solve the
mystery of Sir Charles's death. The sooner he captured the false Mrs. Brown,
who, presumably, had murdered the old man, the sooner would he lead Lillian to
the altar. Therefore he was feverishly anxious to begin, but for the life of him
he did not see how to make a start. He had absolutely no experience of what
constituted the business of a detective, and was daunted at the outset by the
difficulties of the path. All the same he never thought of halting, but pressed
forward without a pause. And the first step he took was to consult a friend, on
the obvious assumption that two heads are better than one. It was Freddy
Laurance whom he decided to interview, since that very up-to-date young
journalist knew every one of any note, and almost everything of interest, being,
indeed, aware of much of which the ordinary man in the street was ignorant. He
and Dan had been to Oxford together, and for many years had been the best of
friends. Laurance had been brought up in the expectation of being a rich man.
But over-speculation ruined his father, and on leaving the University he was
thrown unprepared on the world to make his money as best he could, without any
sort of training in particular. Hearty praise from an expert for three or four
newspaper articles suggested journalism, and having an observant eye and a ready
pen, the young man was successful from the beginning. For a time he was a
free-lance, writing indiscriminately for this journal and for that, until the
proprietor of <i>The Moment</i>, a halfpenny daily, secured his exclusive services at
a salary which procured Freddy the luxuries of life. This was something to have
achieved at the age of five and twenty. <i>The Moment</i> was a bright
shoot-folly-as-it-flies sort of journal, which detailed the news of the day in
epigrammatic scraps. Its longest articles did not exceed a quarter of a column,
and important events were usually restricted to paragraphs. It, indeed, skimmed
the cream of events, and ten minutes' study of its sheets gave a busy man all
the information he required concerning the doings of humanity. Also it daily
published an extra sheet concerned entirely with letters from the public to the
public, and many of these were prolix, as the paragraph rule did not apply to
this portion of the journal. People wrote herein on this, that, and the other
thing, ventilating their ideas and suggesting schemes. And as many wrote many
bought, so that friends and relatives might read their letters, therefore vanity
gave <i>The Moment</i> quite a large circulation independent of its orthodox issue.
The proprietor made money in two ways; by supplying gossip for curious people,
and by giving vain persons the chance of seeing themselves in print. Seeing what
human nature is, it is scarcely to be wondered at that <i>The Moment</i> was a great
success, and sold largely in town and country. Freddy's post was that of a
roving correspondent. Whenever any event of interest took place in any of the
four quarters of the globe, Laurance went to take notes on the spot, and his
information was boiled down into concise, illuminative paragraphs. Indeed, the
older journalists said that it was hardly worth while for him to make such long
journeys for the sake of condensed-milk news; but, as Freddy's details were
always amusing as well as abrupt, the editor and the public and the proprietor
were all satisfied. A man who can flash a vivid picture into the dullest mind in
few words is well worth money. Therefore was Laurance greatly appreciated. Dan
walked to a grimy lane leading from Fleet Street with some doubt in his puzzled
mind as to whether Freddy would be in his office. At a moment's notice, the man
would dart off to the ends of the earth, and was more or less on the move
throughout the three hundred and sixty-five days of the year. But, of late,
sensational events had concentrated themselves in England, so Dan hoped that his
friend would be on the spot. An inquiry from the gorgeous individual who guarded
the entrance to the red brick building wherein <i>The Moment</i> was printed and
published and composed revealed that Mr. Laurance was not only in London, but in
his office at the very second, so Dan sent up his name, and rejoiced at the
catching of this carrier-pigeon. And it was a good omen also that Freddy saw him
straight away, since he generally refused himself to every one on the plea of
business. &quot;But I couldn't resist seeing you, Dan,&quot; remarked Mr. Laurance, when
he had shaken hands, before supplying his visitor with a cigarette and a chair.
&quot;I was coming to see you, if the mountain hadn't come to Mahommed!&quot; Dan lighted
up, and through the smoke of tobacco stared inquisitively at his friend,
wondering what this introductory remark meant. Laurance was rather like Dan in
personal appearance, being tall and slim and clean-shaven, with Greek features
and an aristocratic look. But he was decidedly fair, as Halliday was decidedly
dark, and his eyes were less like those of an eagle than the eyes of the
aviator. But then Laurance was not accustomed to the boundless spaces of the
air, although he had twice ascended in an airship; therefore the new expression
of the new race was wanting. Nevertheless, he looked a capable, alert young man,
able to get the full value out of every minute. He was an admirable type of the
restless, present-day seeker. &quot;Well, Mahommed,&quot; said Dan, leisurely, &quot;here's the
mountain. What have you to say to it?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;That murder of Sir Charles Moon.&quot;
Halliday quivered with surprise. It was so amazing that Laurance should hit upon
the very subject, which employed his own thoughts. &quot;Yes?&quot; he inquired. &quot;You are
engaged to Miss Moon; you were in the house when the crime was committed; you
saw the body; you----&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Stop! Stop! I was not in the house when the crime was
committed. I returned there from the theatre some time later--in fact about
midnight. I certainly did see the body. As to being engaged to Miss Moon--h'm! I
came to see about that, Freddy.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;The deuce you did. Great minds jump. What?&quot;
Laurance puffed a blue cloud, sat down astride a chair and leaned his arms on
the back. &quot;Strange!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;That you and I should be on the hunt. Well it is.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;On the
hunt!&quot; echoed Laurance, staring. &quot;What do you mean?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I should rather ask that
question of you,&quot; said Dan drily. &quot;Sir Charles is dead and buried these many
weeks, and the woman who assassinated him can't be found, in spite of the reward
and the effort of the police. Why, at this late hour, do you wish to rake up
stale news? I thought that <i>The Moment</i> was more up-to-date.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;It will be very
much up-to-date when the next murder is committed,&quot; observed Laurance, grimly
and significantly. The legs of Dan's chair grated, as he pushed back in sheer
surprise. &quot;What do you mean by the next murder?&quot; he demanded sharply. &quot;Well,
this gang----&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Gang! gang! Who says there is a gang?&quot; and Dan's thoughts flew
back to Durwin's reason for visiting Sir Charles. &quot;Humph!&quot; growled Laurance,
thrusting his hands into his pockets. &quot;I'm disappointed. I thought you knew
more.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I know a good deal,&quot; retorted the other quickly, &quot;but I don't intend to
talk to you about what I know until I learn your game.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;What about your own?&quot;
&quot;That comes later also,&quot; said Halliday promptly. &quot;Go on! I want to know why you
rake up Moon's murder.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Naturally you do, seeing you are engaged to the
daughter.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Am I? I am not quite sure. She loves me and I love her, but the new
baronet wants her to marry Lord Curberry. She refused, and I kicked up a row
some hours back. Result, we are on probation for one year, during which time I
am to discover the assassin of Sir Charles.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;And if you don't?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Time enough to
talk about that when I fail,&quot; said Halliday coolly; &quot;at least I have twelve
months to hunt round. I came for your help, but it seems that you want mine.
Why?&quot; Freddy, through sheer absence of mind, flung away a half-smoked cigarette
and lighted another. Then he rose and strolled across the room to lean his
shoulders against the mantelpiece. &quot;We can help one another, I think,&quot; was his
final observation. &quot;I hope so. In any case I intend to marry Lillian. All the
same, to pacify Sir John, I am willing to become a detective. You know my game.
Yours?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Listen,&quot; said Laurance vivaciously. &quot;I forgot all about the murder,
since there seemed to be no chance of the truth coming to the light, and so did
every one else for the same reason. But a few nights ago I was dining out, and
met a chap called Durwin----&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Scotland Yard man,&quot; interrupted Dan, nodding
several times. &quot;He came to see Sir Charles on business and found the corpse.&quot;
&quot;Just so. Well, after dinner we had a chat, and he told me that he was anxious
to learn who killed Moon, because he didn't want any more murders of the kind to
happen--as a police official, you understand.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Strange he should be
confidential on that point,&quot; murmured Halliday thoughtfully, &quot;seeing that he
wished his theory regarding a possible gang kept quiet, in the hope of making
discoveries.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;He has changed his mind about secrecy, and so has Tenson,&quot; said
Freddy. &quot;Oh!&quot; Dan raised his eyebrows. &quot;The Inspector. You have seen him also?&quot;
Laurance nodded. &quot;After I saw Durwin, and learned what he had to say I saw
Tenson, and interviewed him. They told me about the fly on the neck, and
remembering the case of the purple fern, and having regard to the fact that the
fly in question was artificial, both men are inclined to believe in the
existence of a gang, whose trade-mark the said fly is.&quot; Dan nodded again. &quot;Quite
so; and then Durwin came to see Moon and hear about the gang. He found him
dead.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;So you said; so Durwin said,&quot; rejoined Laurance quietly. &quot;It seems very
certain, putting this and that together, that Sir Charles became dangerous to
this gang, whatever it is, and wherever it exists, so was put to death by the
false Mrs. Brown, who came expressly to kill him.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;So far I am with you on all
fours,&quot; said Halliday. &quot;Well?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Well, both Durwin and Tenson, dreading lest the
gang may commit another crime, wish me to make the matter as public as I can, so
as to frighten the beasts.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;H'm!&quot; said Dan, looking at his neat brown boots.
&quot;They have changed their minds, it seems. Their first idea was to keep the
matter quiet, so as to catch these devils red-handed. However, publicity may be
a good thing. How do you intend to begin?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I have got facts from Tenson and
from Durwin,&quot; said Freddy promptly; &quot;and now, since you saw the body and found
the fly, I want to get the facts from you. On what I acquire I shall write a
letter in that extra sheet of ours, and you can be pretty certain from what you
know of human nature that any amount of people will reply to my letter.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;They
may reply to no purpose.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I'm not so sure of that, Dan. If I mention the fly as
a trade-mark and recall the strange case of the purple fern, some one may write
about matters known to themselves from positive knowledge. If this gang exists,
it has committed more murders than one, but the fly being a small insect may not
have been noticed as a trade-mark in the other crimes. I wonder you spotted it
anyhow.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;It was easily seen, being on the back of the neck near the wound.
Besides, flies in November--the month of the murder--are rare. Finally Tenson
discovered the fly to be artificial, which shows that it was purposely placed on
the dead man's neck, near the wound. H'm!&quot; he reflected, &quot;perhaps someone may
know of some crime with the fly trade-mark, and in that case we can be certain
that such a gang does exist.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;So I think,&quot; cried Laurance quickly, &quot;and for
that reason I intend to start a discussion by writing an open letter. Publicity
may frighten the beasts into dropping their trade; on the other hand, it may
goad the gang into asserting itself. In either case the subject will be
ventilated, and we may learn more or less of the truth.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yes. I think it's a
good idea, Freddy. And the perfume? Did Durwin or the Inspector tell you
anything about the perfume. No, I can see by your blank stare that they didn't.
Listen, Freddy, and store this knowledge in your blessed brain, my son. It is a
clue, I am sure,&quot; and Halliday forthwith related to his attentive listener
details concerning the strange perfume which had impregnated the clothes of the
dead man. &quot;And Sir Charles hated perfumes,&quot; he ended, emphatically; &quot;he didn't
even like Lillian or Mrs. Bolstreath to use them, and they obeyed him.&quot;
&quot;Curious,&quot; mused the journalist, and idly scribbling on his blotting-paper; he
was back at his desk by this time. &quot;What sort of scent is it?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;My dear chap,
you ask me to describe the impossible,&quot; retorted Dan, with uplifted eyebrows.
&quot;How the deuce can I get the kind of smell into your head? It must be smelt to
be understood. All I can say is that the perfume was rich and heavy, suggestive
of drowsiness. Indeed, I used that word, and Tenson thought of some kind of
chloroform used, perhaps, to stupefy the victim before killing him. But there
was an odor about the mouth or nose.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;On the handkerchief, perhaps?&quot; suggested
the reporter. &quot;No. Tenson smelt the handkerchief.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Well, if this Mrs. Brown
used this perfume, you and Miss Moon and Mrs. Bolstreath must have smelt it on
her in the hall. I understand from Durwin that you all three saw the woman.&quot;
&quot;Yes. And Lillian, poor girl, persuaded her father to see the wretch. But we did
not smell the perfume on the woman. Tenson or Durwin--I forget which--asked us
the question.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Humph!&quot; said Laurance, after a pause; &quot;it may be a kind of
trade-mark, like the fly business.&quot; He took a note. &quot;I shall use this evidence
in my letter to the public. I suppose, Dan, you would recognize the scent
again?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Oh, yes! I have a keen sense of smell, you know. But I don't expect I
shall ever drop across this particular fragrance, Freddy.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;There's always
Monsieur Chance, you know,&quot; remarked Laurance, tapping his white teeth with a
pencil. &quot;Perhaps the gang use this scent so as to identify one another--in the
dark it may be--like cats. How does that strike you?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;As purely theoretical,&quot;
said Dan, with a shrug, and reached for another cigarette; &quot;it's a case of
perhaps, and perhaps not.&quot; Laurance assented. &quot;But everything so far is
theoretical in this case,&quot; he argued; &quot;you have told me all you know?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Every
bit, even to my year of probation. Do you know Curberry?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yes. He was a slap-up
barrister. A pity he got title and money, as he has left the Bar, and is a good
man spoiled. Lucky chap all the same, as his uncle and cousin both died
unexpectedly, to give him his chance of the House of Lords.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;How did they die?&quot;
&quot;Motor accident. Car went over a cliff. Only the chauffeur was saved, and he
broke both legs. Do you know the present Lord Curberry?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I have seen him, and
think he's a dried-up, cruel-looking beast,&quot; said Dan, with considerable
frankness. &quot;I'd rather see Lillian dead than his wife.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Hear, hear!&quot; applauded
Laurance, smiling. &quot;The girl's too delightful to be wasted on Curberry. You have
my blessing on the match, Dan.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Thanks,&quot; said Halliday ruefully, &quot;but I have to
bring it off first. Sir John's infernally clever, and managed to get both
Lillian and me to consent to let matters stand over for a year, during which
time I guess he'll push Curberry's suit. But I can trust Lillian to be true to
me, bless her, and Mrs. Bolstreath is quite on our side. After all,&quot; murmured
the young man disconsolately, &quot;it's only fair that Sir Charles should be
avenged. Perhaps it would be selfish for Lillian and me to marry and live happy
ever afterwards, without making some attempt to square things. The question is
how to start. I'm hanged if I know, and so I came to you.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Well,&quot; said Laurance
thoughtfully, &quot;there's a hope of Monsieur Chance you know. In many ways you may
stumble on clues even without looking for them, since this gang--if it
exists--must carry on an extensive business. All you can do, Dan, is to keep
your eyes and ears and nose open--the last for that scent, you know. On my part
I shall write the letter, and publish it in the annex of The Moment. Then we
shall see what will happen.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yes, I think that's about the best way to begin.
Stir up the muddy water, and we may find what is at the bottom of the pond. But
there's one thing to be considered, and that is money. If I'm going to hunt for
these scoundrels I need cash, and to own up, Freddy, I haven't very much.&quot;
&quot;You're so beastly extravagant,&quot; said Laurance grinning, &quot;and your private
income goes nowhere.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Huh! what's five hundred a year?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Ten pounds a week,
more or less. However, there's your aviation. I hear that you take people
flights for money?&quot; Dan nodded. &quot;It's the latest fashionable folly, which is a
good thing for me, old son. I get pretty well paid, and it means fun.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;With
some risk of death,&quot; said Laurance drily. &quot;Well, yes. But that is a peculiarity
of present-day fun. People love to play with death--it thrills them. However, if
I am to hunt for the assassin of Sir Charles, I can't give much attention to
aviation, and I repeat that I want money. Oceans of it.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Would two thousand
pounds suit you?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Rather. Only I'm not going to borrow from you, old man, thank
you.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I haven't that amount to lend,&quot; said Freddy, drily; &quot;but you must have
seen, if you read our very interesting paper, that our proprietor has offered a
prize of two thousand pounds for a successful flight from London to York.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;A
kind of up-to-date Dick Turpin, I suppose,&quot; laughed Dan, rising and stretching
his long limbs. &quot;Good, I'll have a shot, I may win.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;You will, if you use a
Vincent machine.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Vincent, Vincent? Where have I heard that name?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Everywhere
if you know anything of the aviation world,&quot; snapped Laurance rather crossly,
for at times Dan's indolence in acquiring necessary information annoyed him.
&quot;Solomon Vincent, who has been inventing airships and new-fangled aeroplanes for
ever so long.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yes, yes! I remember now. He's a genius. Every one knows him.&quot;
&quot;Every one knows of him, except yourself; but no one knows him personally. He
lives a secluded life up in Hillshire, on the borders of the moors, where he can
find wide space for his experiments in aerial craft. I interviewed him a year
ago, and--and----&quot; Laurance blushed red. &quot;Hullo, what's this?&quot; asked Dan
shrewdly. &quot;Can it be that the inventor has a daughter fair?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;A niece,&quot; retorted
Laurance, recovering; &quot;why shouldn't I be in love as well as you, Halliday?
However, that doesn't matter.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;It matters a great deal to you.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Never mind.
What you have to do is to secure one of Vincent's machines and try for this
race. If you win the prize you will have heaps of money to search for the gang.
But why doesn't Miss Moon----&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I don't take Lillian's money,&quot; said Dan curtly,
and blushed in his turn. &quot;It is a good idea, Freddy. How can I get hold of the
machine?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I shall take you up to Hillshire next week, and you can see Vincent
for yourself. He can talk to you, and----&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;And you can talk to the niece.
What's her name?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Oh, shut up and get out,&quot; said Laurance, turning away,
&quot;you're interrupting my work.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Going to write a letter to the beloved,&quot; said
Dan, leisurely making for the door. &quot;All right, old son, I'll go. You know my
address, so write me when you want me. I'd like to see Vincent's machines, as I
hear he has made several good improvements, and everything tells in a race.
Salaam!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Keep your eyes open,&quot; Laurance called after him; &quot;remember Monsieur
Chance may prove to be our best friend.&quot; Dan departed, shrugging his shoulders.
&quot;I don't believe in heaven-sent miracles,&quot; were his last words. But they were
wasted on Freddy, for that alert young man was already buried in his work. It
was painful to witness such industry, in Halliday's opinion. In an inquiring
frame of mind, the amateur detective strolled along Fleet Street, thinking of
Lillian instead of keeping his wits about him, as Freddy had requested. It
seemed impossible that he should strike on a clue without deliberately searching
for it, which he did not feel inclined to do at the moment. Monsieur Chance,
indeed! He was a mythical personage in whom this sceptical young man did not
believe. Besides love dominated his thoughts to the exclusion of minor matters,
and he dreamed about his darling all along the Strand. Thus he did not look
where he was going, and stumbled into the midst of a Charing Cross crowd, where
a motor had broken down after colliding with a 'bus. A policeman was conversing
with the chauffeur and the 'bus driver, who were conversing abusively with one
another. The crowd blocked the street and stopped the traffic in order to enjoy
the conversation, which left nothing to be desired in the way of free language.
Dan halted idly, as a spectator, not because he wished to be one, but for the
very simple reason that he could not get through the crowd into Trafalgar
Square. Thrust up against one man, and wedged in by two others, and surrounded
by hundreds, he grumbled at the delay, and peered over shoulders to see when the
incident would end. As he did so, he suddenly in his mind's eye saw a vision of
Sir Charles lying dead in the well-lighted library. While wondering why he
thought of the crime at this particular moment, he became aware that a familiar
scent assailed his nostrils, the scent about which he had talked to Durwin and
Tenson and Laurance. Nosing like a hound, he tried to find the person from whom
it emanated, and almost immediately later the man turned, and Dan found himself
face to face with Marcus Penn.</p>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<h4>CHAPTER V</h4>

<h5><a name="div1_05" href="#div1Ref_05">MUDDY WATER</a></h5>
<br>

<p>The secretary of the late
Sir Charles Moon smiled irresolutely when he recognized Dan. That young
gentleman, who thought Penn a weak-kneed idiot, had never taken much notice of
him, but for the fact that he was perfumed with the unusual scent would not have
spoken to him now. But as he looked at the lank creature with his yellow face,
and scanty moustache, he guessed that he was exactly the effeminate sort of
person who would use perfume. What he wished to know was why he affected this
particular kind of fragrance, and whence he obtained it. To gain the information
he pretended a friendliness for the man he was far from feeling. Dan, strong,
virile, and self-confident, was not altogether just to Penn, who was not
responsible for his pallid looks and weak character. But Halliday was not a
perfect individual by any means, and had yet to learn that the weak are meant to
be protected and helped instead of being despised. &quot;You here, Mr. Penn?&quot; said
Dan, thus formal to mark the difference between them. &quot;Yes,&quot; replied the man in
his faint hesitating voice, and, as they moved out of the crowd, Halliday smelt
the weird perfume more strongly than ever shaken from Penn's clothes by his
movements. &quot;I stopped to look at the accident.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;A very ordinary one,&quot; rejoined
Mr. Halliday, with a shrug. &quot;By the way, I have not seen you since the funeral
of Sir Charles. What are you doing now, if I may ask?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I am secretary to Lord
Curberry.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Oh!&quot; The reply gave Dan something of a shock, for he did not expect
at the moment to hear his rival's name. But then the whole incident of meeting
Penn and smelling the incriminating perfume was strange. Monsieur Chance had
proved himself to be an actuality instead of the mythical personage Dan had
believed him to be. It was certainly odd that the meeting had taken place, and
odder still that Penn should prove to be the servant of Curberry. As Halliday
said nothing more than &quot;Oh!&quot; the other man stroked his moustache and explained.
&quot;Sir John got me the post, Mr. Halliday,&quot; he said, with his shifty eyes anywhere
but on Dan's inquiring face. &quot;I was quite stranded after Sir Charles's
unexpected death, and did not know where to turn for employment. As I support a
widowed mother, the situation was rather serious, so I took my courage in my
hands and went to Sir John. He was good enough to recommend me to Lord Curberry,
and I have been with his lordship for a month, more or less.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I congratulate
you, Mr. Penn, and Lord Curberry, also. Sir Charles always said you were an
excellent secretary,&quot; Dan stopped as Penn bowed his acknowledgments to the
compliment, and cast a keen side glance at the man. They were walking through
Trafalgar Square by this time, passing under the shadow of Nelson's Column. &quot;Do
you know what I was thinking of when behind you in the crowd yonder, Mr. Penn?&quot;
he asked abruptly, and it must be confessed rather undiplomatically, if he
wished to get at the truth. &quot;No,&quot; said the secretary, with simplicity and
manifest surprise. &quot;No, Mr. Halliday, how can I guess your thoughts?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I was
thinking of the murder of your late employer,&quot; said Dan straightly. Penn blinked
and shivered. &quot;It's a horrible subject to think about,&quot; he remarked in a low
voice. &quot;I can scarcely get it out of my own thoughts. I suppose the sight of me
reminded you of the crime, Mr. Halliday?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Scarcely, since I was behind you, and
did not recognize you until you turned,&quot; replied Dan, calmly, and the other
appeared to be surprised. &quot;Then how----&quot; he began, only to be cut short. &quot;It's
that scent.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Scent!&quot; echoed Penn nervously, but manifestly still surprised. &quot;I
don't understand exactly what you mean, Mr. Halliday. I like scent, and use much
of it.&quot; Dan's lip curled. &quot;So I perceive. But where did you get the particular
scent you are using now, may I ask?&quot; Something in his tone annoyed the
secretary, for he drew himself up and halted. &quot;I don't know why you should
criticize my tastes, Mr. Halliday.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I'm not criticizing them, and don't jump
down my throat. But you reek of some strange perfume, which I last smelt----&quot; He
paused. &quot;You cannot have smelt it anywhere,&quot; said Penn indifferently. &quot;What do
you mean by that exactly?&quot; asked Dan with considerable sharpness. Penn resumed
his walk and drew his light eyebrows together. &quot;I am willing to explain as soon
as you tell me why you speak of the scent.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Hang it, man,&quot; rejoined Halliday,
dropping into step, &quot;any one would notice the scent and speak of it since it is
so strong.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Oh&quot;--Penn's brow cleared--&quot;I understand now. You have taken a fancy
to the scent and wish me to get you some.&quot; Halliday was about to make an
indignant denial, when he suddenly changed his mind, seeing a chance of learning
something. &quot;Well, can you get me some?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;No,&quot; said Penn coolly; &quot;I cannot. This
is a particular perfume which comes from the Island of Sumatra. I have a cousin
there who knows that I like perfumes, and he sent me a single bottle.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Can't I
buy it anywhere?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;No, it is not to be obtained in England,&quot; said Penn curtly.
&quot;In that case,&quot; said Halliday slowly, &quot;it is strange that I should have smelt
the same perfume on the clothes of Sir Charles after his death.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Did you?&quot; Penn
looked surprised. &quot;That is impossible. Why, Sir Charles detested scents, and I
never dared to use this one until I left him for the night.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;You used it on the
night of the murder?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Of course. I used it every night when I left Sir Charles.
On that evening he sent me away with my usual batch of letters, and was going
down to the House later. I would not have seen him until the next morning, so I
took the opportunity to indulge in this taste.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Then how did Sir Charles's
clothes become impregnated with it?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I am unable to say. Why do you ask?
Surely&quot;--Penn turned an alarmed face towards the speaker, and looked yellower
than ever--&quot;surely you do not suspect me of keeping back anything from the
police likely to lead to the detection of the assassin.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Ask yourself, Mr.
Penn,&quot; said Dan coldly. &quot;I and Inspector Tenson and Mr. Durwin smelt this
particular perfume on the clothes of the dead man, and I do not mind telling you
that the police consider it something of a clue.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;A clue to what? To me? It
must be, since I alone possess this scent. I certainly came into the library
when summoned by Mr. Durwin, and I helped to look after Sir Charles. As I was
strongly perfumed with the scent it is not impossible that my employer's clothes
took what, doubtless, you will call the taint. I think,&quot; ended Penn in a
dignified manner, &quot;that such is the proper explanation. You have found a mare's
nest, Mr. Halliday.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Upon my word, I believe I have,&quot; said Dan, quite
good-humoredly, &quot;but you must forgive me, Mr. Penn. Inspector Tenson agreed with
me that the fly and the scent were clues.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;About the fly I know nothing,&quot; said
the secretary positively, &quot;but this scent is not to be had in England, and Sir
Charles's clothes could only have gathered the fragrance from mine. If Inspector
Tenson suspects me----&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;No, no, no!&quot; interrupted Halliday quickly. &quot;I assure
you that he does not.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;He would if you told him of our meeting,&quot; retorted Penn
as they passed into Piccadilly Circus, &quot;and as I don't like even a suspicion to
rest on me, Mr. Halliday--for my good name is my fortune--I shall go and see him
and explain the whole circumstance. Indeed, if he wishes it, I shall give him
the bottle which my cousin sent me from Sumatra, and never shall I use the scent
again. I do not like these injurious suspicions.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Don't make a mountain out of
a mole-hill,&quot; said Dan, drily; &quot;if I have hurt your feelings, I apologize.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I
accept your apology only on condition that you accept my explanation.&quot; Dan
inwardly chuckled at Penn's dignity, but replied, readily enough. &quot;Oh, yes, for
if I did not accept your explanation I should not make any apology. You are
probably right since the scent must have got on to Sir Charles's clothes from
your own. The clue--as we took it to be--has ended in smoke.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;But don't you
think that I should see Inspector Tenson and explain?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;There is no need,&quot; Dan
assured him, soothingly. &quot;If the Inspector says anything about the scent, I
shall explain; and, after all, it was I who suggested the perfume as a clue.&quot;
&quot;Would you like what is left of the bottle?&quot; asked Penn, pacified by the very
frank apology of the other. &quot;No, thanks, I never use perfumes. I hate them.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;So
did Sir Charles,&quot; mused Penn, and eyeing Dan with a lack-lustre gaze. &quot;I wonder
he did not suspect me of liking them. If he had come upon me scented in this
manner, he would have kicked me out.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;It is to be hoped Lord Curberry has not
the same dislike,&quot; said Dan, who having learned all he wished, desired to escape
from such boring society. &quot;No, he has not,&quot; said Penn with great simplicity; &quot;he
is very kind to me. I suppose he will marry Miss Moon.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Then you suppose wrong.
He will not,&quot; snapped Halliday roughly. &quot;He loves her devotedly,&quot; insisted the
secretary, and with a glint of malice in his pale-colored eyes. &quot;Good-day,&quot;
rejoined Dan shortly, as he did not wish to argue the matter. He turned into
Regent Street--for by this time they had crossed the Circus--when Penn ran after
him and seized his arm. &quot;Is there any chance of the woman who killed Sir Charles
being found?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;No,&quot; replied Dan, halting for a moment. &quot;Why?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Because Sir
Charles was good to me, and I should like his death to be avenged. That is only
natural. Surely the police will search.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;They are searching, Mr. Penn, and can
discover nothing.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Perhaps Lord Curberry may hunt for this woman. I shall ask
him to, and as he loves Miss Moon so devotedly, he will try to learn the truth.&quot;
Irritated by this speech--for Penn knew very well of the rivalry--Dan became
scarlet. &quot;I shall discover the truth. Lord Curberry need not trouble himself.&quot;
&quot;If you discover the truth----&quot; began Penn, and hesitated. &quot;Well?&quot; asked
Halliday sharply. &quot;I think Lord Curberry will certainly marry Miss Moon.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;What
do you mean by that?&quot; demanded Dan, but Penn gave no answer. Shaking his head
significantly, he stepped back, and in one moment was lost in the midst of the
crowd which thronged the corner. Halliday would have followed, for the man's
last observation seemed to hint that he knew more about the truth than he was
disposed to admit; but many people came between him and the secretary, so it was
impossible to get hold of him again. Dan was forced to walk on alone and he
walked on pondering deeply. Did Penn know the truth? It seemed impossible that
he should know it. The evidence of the typewriting girl went to show that he had
not left his private room all the evening until summoned by Durwin when the
death was discovered. What Penn said about the perfume appeared to be reasonable
enough, as he certainly had handled the body, and if reeking of the scent--as he
was reeking on this very day--it was not surprising that the odor should
communicate itself to the dress clothes of the dead man. Some odors cling very
powerfully, and endure for a considerable time. This Sumatra scent assuredly had
done so, for it was quite three hours after the death that Dan himself had seen
the corpse, and even then he had smelt the perfume. However, on the face of it,
Halliday saw no reason to doubt Penn's statement, and quite understood how he
became, through Sir John's mediation, the secretary of Lord Curberry. Only the
last speech of the secretary was strange. Why should he say that, if the truth
were discovered by Dan, Curberry would marry the girl, when, on the discovery of
the truth--so far as Dan could see--the marriage of himself to Lillian depended?
Dan could find no answer to this question, and had half a mind to follow Penn to
his new employer's house, so as to force an explanation. But as he knew Curberry
did not like him, he decided to let matters stand as they were, and only reveal
what he had heard to Laurance. For the next four or five days, young Halliday
went about his business in a quiet, determined manner, and thought as little as
possible of Lillian. He did not even write or call to see her, since he wished
to give up his whole attention to discovering the truth about Moon's death. If
he thought of love and Lillian, he certainly could not concentrate his mind on
the necessary search. And it was very necessary, if he intended to marry the
girl. He became certain that in some way Sir John intended to trick him, but if
he found out the false Mrs. Brown, and solved the mystery, Sir John would be
forced out of sheer justice to sanction the marriage. It was heroical of
Halliday to turn his thoughts from his beloved and it was no easy task to one so
deeply in love as he. But he saw the need of it, and manfully set himself to
endure present pain for future joy. Whether Lillian saw things in the same
light, or resented his neglect, he did not know, as he had no word from her,
neither came there any letter from Mrs. Bolstreath. Dan had, certainly been
pushed out of the girl's life by her astute uncle; but it was his own common
sense that kept him out of it--for the time being--be it understood. Love
demands its martyrs, and Halliday had become one for Love's sake. By doing so,
although he knew it not, he was displaying more real love towards her than he
had ever done in his life before. Meanwhile, Laurance lost no time in publishing
his letter, which dealt with the mystery of Moon's death. As <i>The Moment</i>,
including its extra letter-writing sheet, had a large circulation, and as it was
a season devoid of news, the letter caused great discussions. It was
sufficiently alarming to those who loved law and order, since it boldly
announced that a gang of criminals existed which coldly and cautiously and
deliberately employed its members to put people to death. The letter called
attention to the fly--and that an artificial one--on Sir Charles's neck near the
poisoned wound, and declared that such was the sign-manual of the accursed
society. No mention was made of the scent, since Dan had explained what Penn had
said to Laurance, and Laurance had accepted the explanation as valid. But there
was quite enough in the letter to startle the most dull, especially when the
writer called attention to the happening of various mysterious murders, and
suggested that such were the work of this misguided set of people who
constituted the unknown gang; finally, Freddy ended his letter by saying that
Moon had knowledge of the gang, and had sent for a Scotland Yard official--name
not given--to explain the whole matter, when he met with his death. It was a
fact, therefore, that the false Mrs. Brown was an emissary of the gang who had
been sent to murder Sir Charles, and had performed her vile errand only too
well. A postscript to the epistle invited discussion, and particularly called
upon any person who knew of an artificial fly being found on a corpse to give
evidence. In two days the sheet was filled with letters from various people, and
the matter was much discussed. Some of the writers laughed at the idea of such a
society existing in a civilized country such as England, while others expressed
alarm and asked what the police were doing not to arrest the criminals. These
last scribes evidently entirely forgot that no one knew where the central
quarters of the gang were, and that the letter of Mr. Laurance was an attempt to
root out the heart of the mystery. Those who appeared in print and aided the
circulation of <i>The Moment</i> by buying their own lucubrations certainly did not
help much. The generality of the letters were discursive and ornate, wandering
very much from the point, and giving no positive information such as would
assist Freddy's purpose. But three or four epistles drew attention to certain
mysterious crimes, the perpetrators of which had never been brought to justice,
and who were not even known. There was the case of a young girl found dead on
the Brighton railway line, near Redhill, and who must have been thrown out of
the train. Then some one wrote about a miser in the East End who had been
strangled, and another person recalled the drowning of a well-known
philanthropist in the Serpentine. A verdict of suicide had been brought in as
regards this last victim, but the writer of the letter positively asserted that
the philanthropist had not the slightest intention of making away with himself.
Finally came a batch of letters concerning children who had been murdered. But
only in one case did it appear that any fly was seen on the victim, and that was
when a schoolmistress was stabbed to the heart while in bed and asleep. The
assassin had entered and escaped by the window, and the victim's mother--who
wrote the letter drawing attention to this case--had found the fly on her
daughter's cheek. She had thought nothing of it at the time, and had brushed
away the insect. But after the mention of the fly on Sir Charles Moon's neck,
she remembered the incident. Also it turned out that the schoolmistress, had she
lived, would have inherited a large sum of money. It was this last circumstance
that suggested the intervention of the gang to murder the girl, so that someone
else might inherit. But all the letters dealing with the various cases were
vague, and no enlightening details could be given. All that could be said was
that there were many unusual deaths, the mystery of which could not be solved.
Laurance, reading the letters during the week of their appearance, felt sure
that the gang existed, but he was more or less alone in his opinion. Even Dan
was doubtful. &quot;It seems such a large order for a number of people to band
themselves together, to murder on this comprehensive scale,&quot; he objected; &quot;and I
don't quite see the object. Many of the victims mentioned in these letters are
poor.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;You seem to have changed your mind about the matter,&quot; said Laurance
drily, &quot;for when my letter appeared you were assured that there was such a
gang.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Only because of Sir Charles's remarks to Durwin.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;It was a pity Sir
Charles was not more explicit,&quot; retorted Freddy crossly. &quot;He had no time to be
explicit,&quot; said Dan patiently, &quot;since he died before he explained. But let us
admit, for the sake of argument, that such a gang exists. Why should the members
murder poor people?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Folks have been murdered by way of revenge, as well as for
money. And let me remind you, Dan, that four or five of these victims mentioned
in the letters had money, or were about to inherit money. I am quite convinced,&quot;
said Laurance, striking the table, &quot;that there is such an association.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;An
association for what?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;You are very dull. To get undesirable people out of the
way. Remember, in the reign of Louis XIV there were dozens of poisoners in Paris
who undertook to kill people when engaged to do so. The reason was for revenge,
or desire for money, or--or--or for other reasons,&quot; ended Laurance vaguely.
&quot;Hum!&quot; Dan stroked his chin, &quot;it may be as you say. Certainly Sir Charles was
got rid of, because he knew too much.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;About this gang,&quot; insisted Laurance,
&quot;since he was to see Durwin about the same. I am certain that such an
association exists.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;You said that before,&quot; Halliday reminded him. &quot;And I say
it again. At all events there is one thing certain--that we have learned from
these letters of many mysterious crimes.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;But only in one case was the fly
discovered,&quot; objected Dan again. &quot;That is not to be wondered at,&quot; replied the
journalist; &quot;the wonder is that such a small insect should be noticed at all. No
one would ever think of connecting a fly, whether dead or alive, with the death.
The mother of this schoolmistress did not, until your experience with regard to
Moon was quoted in my letter. The fly business is quite ridiculous.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;And
perhaps means nothing.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Oh, I think it does, seeing that in Moon's case, the
fly was artificial. Probably in the case of the schoolmistress it was artificial
also, only the mother who noticed it did not make an examination. Why should
she? I wonder the gang don't have a better trade-mark.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Perhaps the gang may
think it would be spotted if it did.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Then why have any trade-mark at all,&quot;
answered Laurance, sensibly. &quot;If there is to be a sign, there should be some
sensible one. If the fly was stamped on the skin, as the purple fern was
stamped, there would be some sense in the matter. But a fly, artificial or real,
is----&quot; Freddy spread out his hands, for words entirely failed him. &quot;Well,&quot; said
Dan after a pause, &quot;I don't know what to say, since everything is so vague.
However, I shall assume that such a gang exists, and shall do my best to aid you
to bring about its destruction, as that means my marriage to Lillian. To help, I
must have money, so the sooner we get North and engage one of Vincent's machines
with all the latest improvements, the better shall I be pleased.&quot; He moved
towards the door, as they were in Laurance's rooms when this conversation took
place, and there he halted. &quot;I think, Freddy, you will have a chance of proving
in your own person, as to the truth of your supposition regarding this gang!&quot;
&quot;What do you mean?&quot; asked Laurance somewhat startled. &quot;Well,&quot; murmured Dan, &quot;the
gang knows you started the hunt for its destruction, as I expect the members
read the papers. If that is the case you will be a source of danger, such as Sir
Charles was and----&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I'll look after myself,&quot; interrupted Laurance grimly.
&quot;Well, if you don't, and the worst comes,&quot; said Dan agreeably, &quot;I shall
carefully examine your corpse for the celebrated fly.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I'll look after myself,&quot;
said Laurance again, &quot;and if you think I am going to give up doing business
through fear of death, you are much mistaken. If I can find the gang and
exterminate the gang, I'll get a much larger salary, and so will be able to
marry Mildred.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Oh, that's her name, is it? Mildred Vincent! Is she pretty?&quot;
&quot;You might not think so, since Miss Moon is your ideal,&quot; said Freddy, with a
blush. &quot;Mildred is dark and tall, and well-proportioned--none of your skimpy
women, old man.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Lillian isn't skimpy,&quot; cried Halliday indignantly. &quot;I never
said she was. Let us call her fairy-like.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;That's better. And your Mildred?&quot;
&quot;You'll see her when we go North the day after tomorrow.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Good!&quot; Dan nodded
thankfully, &quot;we go to Vincent the day after to-morrow?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yes. Meet me at a
quarter to twelve at St. Pancras Station; the train leaves at mid-day and we
change at Thawley for Beswick about four o'clock. I expect we'll arrive--all
going well--at Sheepeak about six.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Good. But why shouldn't all go well?&quot;
inquired Dan, after a pause. Laurance chuckled. &quot;According to you, the gang will
hunt me down, and as you are in my company--well!&quot; he chuckled again. &quot;Oh, I
don't care a cent for the gang, no more than yourself,&quot; retorted Dan with a
shrug. &quot;I'm not even going to think of the beasts. We go North to get the
machine which will enable me to win this two thousand. And then----&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;And then?&quot;
echoed Laurance with a grin. &quot;Then I shall discover the truth, crush the gang,
and marry Lillian.&quot; In this way, therefore, the muddy water was stirred up.</p>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<h4>CHAPTER VI</h4>

<h5><a name="div1_06" href="#div1Ref_06">THE INVENTOR</a></h5>
<br>

<p>Freddy Laurance usually opened his mouth to ask
questions, rarely to talk about himself. In the newspaper world, confidences may
mean copy, given that such are worthy to appear in print. Therefore, as the
young man found, it is just as well to be sparing of personal details, and
having made this discovery, he was careful to keep his tongue between his teeth
in all matters dealing with his private life. This reticence, useful in
business, but wholly unnecessary in friendship--particularly when the friendship
had to do with Dan Halliday--had grown upon Laurance to such an extent that he
said very little about his love affair. Dan, being a genial soul, and a
fellow-sufferer in the cause of Cupid, and having a heart-whole liking for the
journalist, resented being shut out in this way. He therefore made it his
business to extract Freddy's love story from him when the two were in the train
making for Sheepeak, <i>vi</i> Thawley and Beswick. &quot;Where did you meet her?&quot; asked
Dan abruptly, as they had the compartment to themselves, and he had exhausted
not only the newspapers but the magazines. &quot;Her?&quot; repeated Laurance, who was
calmly smoking, with his feet on the opposite seat, &quot;what her?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;The her. The
one girl in the world for you?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Oh, bosh!&quot; Freddy colored, and looked
pleasantly embarrassed. &quot;Is it? Perhaps you are right!&quot; and Dan began to hum a
simple little American song, entitled, &quot;I wonder who's kissing her now.&quot;
Laurance took this personally. &quot;No one is! I can trust her.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Trust who?&quot; asked
Dan innocently. &quot;The person you mentioned now. Miss Vincent, Mildred.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Did I
mention her? Well, now you recall her name, I did. Old man, we are the best of
friends, but this fourth estate habit of holding your confounded tongue is
getting on my nerves. Give yourself a treat by letting yourself go. I am ready
to listen,&quot; and he leaned back with a seraphic smile. Freddy did not fence any
longer, but came out with details. After all, since he could trust Dan, he was
beginning to think that it would be delightful to talk his heart empty. &quot;She's
the dearest girl in the world,&quot; was the preamble. Dan twiddled his thumbs. &quot;We
all say that. Now Lillian----&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Mildred! We are speaking of her.&quot; Freddy spoke
very fast lest his friend should interrupt. Since Dan wanted confidences, Dan
should have them given to him in a most thorough manner. &quot;Mildred is an angel,
and her uncle is an old respectable, clever beast.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yes!&quot; said Halliday
persuasively. &quot;I thought in that way of Sir Charles when he interrupted private
conversations between Lillian and myself. I am of the same opinion as regards
Sir John Moon because----&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yes, I know what you mean by because. But with
regard to Mildred----&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Who is an angel. Yes?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I met her a year ago in
London--Regent Street, to be precise as to locality. A snob spoke to her without
an introduction, so she appealed to me, and I punched his head. Then I escorted
her home----&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;To Hillshire? What a knight-errant,&quot; chuckled Dan. &quot;Don't be an
ass. I escorted her to the Guelph Hotel in Jermyn Street, where she and her
uncle were staying. The uncle appreciated the service I did for his niece, and
made me welcome, especially when he found that, as a newspaper man, I was able
to talk in print about his machines. For an inventor the old man had an
excellent idea of business.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Inventors being generally fools. So you called the
next day to see if Miss Vincent's nerves were better.&quot; Freddy cast a look of
surprise at Dan's dark face. &quot;How did you guess that, Halliday? Well, I did, and
I got on better with Solomon Vincent than ever.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Undoubtedly you got on better
with the niece,&quot; murmured Dan, mischievously. &quot;Well,&quot; Laurance colored, &quot;you
might put it that way.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I do put it that way,&quot; said Dan firmly, &quot;and from
personal experience.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Not with Mildred. Well, to make a long story short, I saw
a great deal of them in town, and took them to dinner and got them theatre
seats, and fell deeper in love every day. Then Vincent asked me to Sheepeak to
inspect his machines and I wrote several articles in <i>The Moment</i>.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Ah! I
thought I remembered Vincent's name. I read those articles. But you didn't
mention the niece.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Ass!&quot; said the journalist scornfully, &quot;is it likely! Well,
that's the whole yarn. I've been several times to Sheepeak and Vincent likes
me.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;To the extent of taking you as a nephew?&quot; inquired Dan, thoughtfully. &quot;No,
hang him! That's why I call him a beast. He says that Mildred is necessary to
his comfort as a housekeeper, and won't allow her to marry me. She is such a
good girl that she obeys her uncle because he brought her up when her parents
died, and has been a father to her.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;A dull romance and a league-long wooing,
with the lady in Hillshire and the swain in London. How long is this
unsatisfactory state of things going to last, my son?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I don't know,&quot; rejoined
Fred mournfully, &quot;until her uncle dies, perhaps.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Then let us hope he'll fly
once too often,&quot; said Dan cheerfully; &quot;but do not be downhearted. I am sure it
will be all right. I shall dance at your wedding and you will dance at mine. By
the way, there's no necessity to talk to Vincent or his niece about our
endeavors to spot this gang.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Of course not. The matter won't be mentioned. All
I am talking about is private, and you come to Sheepeak with me to get a machine
so as to win the London to York race. It will be an advertisement for Vincent.&quot;
&quot;That's all right. And Mildred--talk about her, old man. I know you are dying to
explain the kind of angel she really is. Lull me to sleep with lover's
rhapsodies&quot;--a request, with which Freddy, now having broken the ice, was
perfectly willing to comply. He described Mildred's appearance with a lover's
wealth of details, drew attention to her many admirable qualities, quoted her
speeches, praised her talents, and thus entertained his friend--and incidentally
himself--all the way to Thawley. Dan closed his eyes and listened, puffing
comfortably at his pipe. Occasionally he threw in a word, but for the greater
part of the time held his peace, and let Laurance babble on about his darling's
perfections. Secretly, Dan did not think these could match Lillian's in any way.
At the great manufacturing town of Thawley, which was overshadowed by a cloud of
dun smoke, the travellers left the main line, and crossed to another platform
where they boarded the local train to Beswick. This station was only six miles
down the line, and they turned on their tracks to reach it, since it branched
off from the main artery into the wilds. It nestled at the foot of a lofty hill
covered from top to bottom with trees, now more or less leafless. Laurance
informed his companion that there was a ruined abbey hidden in the wood, and
also pointed out several interesting places, for he was well acquainted with the
locality. At Beswick they piled their bags on a ramshackle old trap, and
proceeded in this to climb up a long, winding, steep road, which mounted
gradually to the moors. As the year was yet wintry and the hour was late, the
air became wonderfully keen, and--as Freddy said--inspiriting. Dan, however, did
not find it so, as he felt quite sleepy, and yawned the whole way until the trap
stopped at the solitary hotel of Sheepeak, a rough stone house, with thick walls
and a slate roof. The landlady, raw-boned, sharp-eyed, and not at all beautiful,
met them at the door, smiling in what was meant for an amiable manner when she
saw Laurance. &quot;Oh, you're here again?&quot; she said defiantly, and Dan noticed that
beyond the Northern burr she did not reproduce the country dialect. &quot;Yes, Mrs.
Pelgrin, and I have brought a friend to stay three or four days. We want two
bedrooms and a sitting-room, and supper straight away.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;You shall have them,&quot;
said Mrs. Pelgrin, still defiantly. &quot;And the price will be a pound each for the
four days,&quot; ventured Freddy. &quot;With ten shillings extra for the sitting-room,&quot;
said Mrs. Pelgrin, fiercely. &quot;Oh, come now.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I'll not take you in for less.&quot;
&quot;Well,&quot; put in Dan, shrugging, &quot;sooner than stand here in the cold and argue, I
shall pay the extra ten shillings.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Cold, do you call it? Cold!&quot; Mrs. Pelgrin's
tone was one of scorn. &quot;Ha, cold!&quot; and she led the way through a flagged stone
passage to a large and comfortable room at the back of the house. &quot;Will this
suit you?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;That's all right, Mrs. Pelgrin,&quot; said Freddy, throwing himself down
on a slippery horse-hair sofa--&quot;and supper?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;You'll have it when it's ready, no
sooner and no later,&quot; barked the ogress, leaving the room. &quot;Cold is it?&quot; and she
laughed hoarsely. &quot;I say, Freddy,&quot; observed Halliday in a lazy tone, &quot;why is the
good lady so very savage?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;She isn't, Mrs. Pelgrin is quite fond of me. I've
stayed here often.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Fond of you?&quot; echoed Dan, with a chuckle. &quot;Good Lord, how
does she speak to those she isn't fond of?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;It's Northern brusqueness. She's
honest----&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;But rude. The two seem to go together with many people. They think
they will be taken for rascals if they are decently polite.&quot; Laurance
remonstrated. &quot;Mrs. Pelgrin is a rough diamond.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I like my jewels polished.
However, here we are and here we stay, and here we eat, if that amiable lady
will bring in supper. Then I shall go to bed, as I shall certainly yawn my head
off if I don't.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;But it's just after six,&quot; cried Laurance. &quot;I want to take you
to see Vincent to-night--this evening, that is.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Go yourself, and see the
beautiful Mildred,&quot; muttered Dan drowsily. &quot;Two's company and three's a crowd.
I'm going to bed&quot;; and, in spite of Laurance's arguments against such sloth, to
bed he went, after a brisk fight with Mrs. Pelgrin over a fire in his sleeping
apartment. He said that he wanted one, while the landlady declared that it was
unnecessary. Finally Dan got his own way, and when the fire was blazing, Mrs.
Pelgrin said good-night. &quot;But you're no more nor a butterfly,&quot; she informed her
guest, and went out banging the door, with muttering remarks concerning people
who felt cold. &quot;No doubt this weather is here regarded as tropical,&quot; murmured
Dan, getting into bed and referring to the weather, and he smiled over Mrs.
Pelgrin's manners until he fell asleep. Next morning Laurance woke him at eight,
and Dan grumbled about getting up, although he was assured that he had slept the
clock round. However, a cold bath soon brisked him up, and he came down to the
sitting-room with an excellent appetite for breakfast. Mrs. Pelgrin brought it
in, and again joked in her fierce way about the cold, which the butterfly--as
she again termed Dan--was supposed to feel so keenly. Laurance talked about
Mildred, who had been delighted to see him, but mentioned regretfully that he
did not think that Dan would get the machine he was in search of. &quot;Why not?&quot;
asked Mr. Halliday, lighting his pipe and finishing his third cup of coffee.
&quot;Vincent wants his aeroplanes exploited, doesn't he? And where will he find a
better chance than for an experienced man, such as I am, flying his latest
invention in <i>The Moment's</i> London to York race?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Vincent's a queer fish.
That's all I can say,&quot; retorted Laurance. &quot;Well, you can't say more and you
can't say less, I suppose. We'll go and have a look at the queer fish in his
pond whenever you like.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;At eleven o'clock then.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Right oh! I can talk to the
uncle and you can talk to the niece. It's a fair division of labor.&quot; This
arrangement was willingly agreed to by Laurance, as Dan was certain it would be
since he saw that his friend was fathoms deep in love. Afterwards, the two went
out of doors and surveyed the landscape. Sheepeak was situated on the top of a
lofty tableland, the village being a tolerably large collection of substantial
stone houses, whence the moors spread north and south, east and west. From where
they were, the friends could see the green squares of cultivated fields, the
purple bloom of the heather, and the azure hues which distance gave to the
distant mountains. Here and there the vast country, which looked enormously
large from the elevation whence they surveyed it, dipped into verdant dales,
snugly clothed with forests, and sprinkled with manor-houses and villages, big
and little. The lands were so far-stretching and the prospect so extensive, that
Dan became mightily impressed with the magnitude of the sky. It covered them
like a huge inverted cup, and as there was nothing to break its league-long
sweep, Dan felt quite small in the immensity which surrounded him above and
below. &quot;I feel like a pill in the Desert of Sahara,&quot; said Mr. Halliday, sighing.
&quot;What is the sensation of feeling like a pill,&quot; rejoined Laurance drily, for he
was not an imaginative individual. &quot;Only a poet can explain, Freddy, and you are
very earthy.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I never knew you were a genius,&quot; snapped Laurance, with a shrug.
&quot;You have much to learn,&quot; replied Dan reprovingly; &quot;and as it's near eleven
o'clock, suppose we light out for Vincent.&quot; Freddy agreed, and skirting the
village for three-quarters of a mile, they suddenly came upon a small cottage,
with walls and roof of yellowish stone covered with lichen, and standing in a
small garden of wind-tormented vegetation. A low stone wall divided this from
the high road, and the visitors entered through a small wooden gate to pass up a
cobble-stone walk to the modest door. But the cottage itself was dwarfed wholly
by huge sheds of wood covered with roofs of galvanized tin, which loomed up
suddenly behind it, on a vast scale more in keeping with the character of the
landscape. These were the workshops of Vincent, where he built his machines and
housed them from prying eyes. The fields at the back cultivated into smooth
lawns were where the aeroplanes started to fly over hill and dale, to the
wonderment of the inhabitants. &quot;Though they are pretty well used to Vincent's
vagaries by this time,&quot; said Freddy, ending his explanation. Mildred received
them in the small parlor of the cottage which was about the size of a doll's
drawing-room, and expressed herself as pleased to make the acquaintance of Mr.
Halliday. Her uncle, she mentioned, was busy as usual in his workshop, but would
see the visitors in half an hour. While she explained, Dan took stock of her,
and admitted that she was really a very amiable and pretty girl, though not a
patch on Lillian. But then Dan did not care for tall ladies with olive
complexions, blue eyes, dark hair, and the regal melancholy look of discrowned
queens. Mildred--the name suited her--was too tall and stately for his taste,
which approved more of little golden-haired women, fairy-like and frolicsome.
Miss Vincent looked serious and thoughtful, and although her smile was
delicious, she smiled very seldom. It seemed to Dan that her solitary life in
these moorlands and in the company--when she enjoyed it--of her morose uncle,
made the girl sober beyond her years, which were not more than two-and-twenty.
However, many minds many tastes, and Dan could not deny but what Freddy's fair
Saxon looks went very well with the Celtic mystic appearance of the inventor's
niece. They were a handsome couple, indeed, but much too solemn in looks and
character for Dan, whose liking leaned to the frivolous side of things. &quot;Don't
you find it dull here, Miss Vincent?&quot; asked Halliday casually. &quot;Dull!&quot; she
echoed, turning her somewhat sad eyes of dark blue in his direction, &quot;oh, not at
all. Why I have a great deal to do. We have only one servant and I assist in the
housework. My uncle is not easy to cater for, as he has many likes and dislikes
with regard to food. Then he employs a certain number of workmen, and I have to
pay them every Saturday. Indeed, I look after all the financial part of my
uncle's business.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Is it a business, or a whim--a hobby?&quot; inquired Dan
respectfully, for, being frivolous, he was struck with awe at the multitude of
Miss Vincent's employments. &quot;Well, more of the last than the first perhaps,&quot;
said Mildred smiling at his respectful expression. &quot;Uncle Solomon really doesn't
care for publicity. All his aim is to construct a perfect machine, and he is
always inventing, and improving, and thinking of new ways in which to obtain the
mastery of the air.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;His machines have been tried by other people, though,&quot;
remarked Freddy. &quot;Oh, yes, and with great success. But uncle doesn't even read
the papers to see what is said about his aeroplanes, although he is always
anxious to read what other inventors are doing, and takes a great interest in
races across Channel and over the Alps, and from city to city. But he is wrapt
up in his own schemes, and works for twelve and more hours out of the
twenty-four in perfecting his machines. Public applause or public rewards don't
appeal to him, you see, Mr. Halliday; it's the work itself.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Ah, that is the
true spirit of genius,&quot; said Dan approvingly, &quot;a man like that is sure to
arrive.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;He will never arrive,&quot; said Miss Vincent quietly, &quot;for as soon as he
arrives at one point, he only regards it as a resting-place to start for a
further goal. He doesn't care for food or drink, or clothes, or politics, or
amusements, or anything for which the ordinary man strives. His machine takes up
all his attention.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Happy man. To have one strong aim and to be allowed to work
at that aim, is the true happiness of any man. I shall be glad to have a talk
with him.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;He doesn't talk much, Mr. Halliday.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;A man obsessed with one idea
seldom does,&quot; retorted the young fellow. &quot;I hope, however, he will let me have a
machine for this race. I can handle any aeroplane, once it is explained to me,
and Freddy here, says that your uncle's machines have many improvements likely
to tell against competitors.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I am not sure if he will let you have a machine,&quot;
said Mildred, her face clouding; &quot;he is very jealous and whimsical you know.&quot;
&quot;Like all inventors,&quot; murmured Laurance rising; &quot;let us go and see him.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yes,&quot;
added Dan, also getting on his feet, &quot;and then you take Freddy away, Miss
Vincent, and let me talk to your uncle. I shall get what I want, somehow.&quot;
Mildred laughed and led the way out of the cottage by the back door. &quot;It is not
an easy task you have set yourself to do,&quot; she said, doubtfully; &quot;here are the
workshops and the buildings where the machines are housed, and yonder is Uncle
Solomon.&quot; The buildings looked plebeian and gimcrack with their flimsy wooden
walls and tin roofs, impressive only in their magnitude. They must have cost a
deal to erect in this neighborhood where all the houses, great and small, were
of stone; and wood was comparatively scarce. Vincent, as Dan considered, must be
well-off to indulge in so expensive a hobby. To be sure by racing he could gain
prizes, and if successful could also sell machines at a good figure; but from
what Mildred said, it seemed to Dan that her uncle had the true jealous spirit
of an inventor, and did not let his darlings go out of his hands if he could
help it. To live on this vast moorland, working at his inventions and
experimenting with his ideas, was enough for Solomon Vincent, without the
applause and rewards of the world. Undoubtedly to carry out his plans he must
have a private income, and not an inconsiderable one at that. &quot;Uncle, this is
Mr. Laurance and Mr. Halliday,&quot; said Mildred, introducing the two young men,
though the first did not require mention. But Vincent, like most inventors, was
absent-minded, and it took him quite a minute to recognize Laurance, whom he had
not seen on the previous night. &quot;Mr. Laurance and Mr. Halliday,&quot; he said
casually, and turning from the workman to whom he had been speaking--&quot;yes, of
course. You understand about the propeller, Quinton,&quot; he added, again taking up
his conversation with the workman, &quot;it must be seen to at once,&quot; and quite
oblivious of the company he went on giving instructions, until the man went away
to do his task, and Mildred touched her uncle's arm. &quot;This is Mr. Laurance and
Mr.----&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Of course I know it is Mr. Laurance,&quot; said Vincent testily, &quot;do you
think I am blind? How do you do, Laurance? Good-by, I am busy.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;And this is Mr.
Halliday who wants a machine,&quot; went on Mildred persuasively. &quot;Indeed. Then Mr.
Halliday shan't get one,&quot; retorted Vincent, and sauntered into the nearest shed
with a scowl on his lean face. He was an acrid-looking man of fifty, with untidy
gray hair and an untrimmed beard. &quot;Follow him, and he will talk,&quot; said Mildred
hastily, &quot;I shall remain here with Freddy, as uncle doesn't like many people to
be about him.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;He is not easy to get on with,&quot; sighed Dan, &quot;I can see that.&quot;
However, he took the girl's advice and went into the shed after the ungracious
inventor, leaving the lovers to return to the cottage parlor, which they did
forthwith. Laurance was quite astute enough to lose no time, since the moments
spent with Mildred were all golden and not easily obtainable. Dan marched into
the shed with a fine air of possession, and again surveyed Vincent, who was
examining some specifications near a window. The man was carelessly dressed in a
shabby suit of blue serge, and seemed to care little about his personal
appearance. Marking once more his shaggy hair and beard, and yellow skin
considerably wrinkled, the young man went up to him. As if waking from a dream,
Vincent looked up, and Dan met the gaze of two very keen dark eyes, whose
expression was anything but amiable. &quot;Who are you, and what do you want?&quot;
demanded the owner of the eyes crossly. &quot;My name is Halliday. I want a machine
to race between London and York. I have just been introduced to you by your
niece.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;My niece should have more sense than to have brought you here,&quot; cried
the inventor fiercely; &quot;you come to spy out my ideas and to steal them.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I
assure you I don't,&quot; said Dan drily. &quot;I am not a genius as you are.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;All the
more reason you should pick my brains,&quot; snapped Vincent in no way mollified by
the compliment as Dan intended he should be. Halliday laughed. &quot;If I did, I
could make no use of my pickings, Mr. Vincent, as you may guess. I can handle a
machine, but I can't put one together.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Who told you about me?&quot; demanded the
man suspiciously. &quot;Laurance.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;He's a meddlesome fool.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Well,&quot; said Dan
cheerfully, &quot;there may be two opinions about that you know.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I don't want him,
and I don't want you, and I don't want any one. Why do you come and bother me
when I don't want you?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Because my wants are to be considered. See here, Mr.
Vincent,&quot; added Halliday in a coaxing voice, for he saw that it was necessary to
humor this clever man like a child, &quot;there is to be a race between London and
York for a big prize given by <i>The Moment</i>, the paper Mr. Laurance works for. I
wish to compete, but my machine isn't so good as I should like it to be. I hear
that you have made several improvements which make for speed and easier handling
of aeroplanes. Let me have one of your latest, and I'll share the prize with
you. It's two thousand, you know.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I don't want money,&quot; snapped Vincent
abruptly. &quot;I congratulate you,&quot; said Dan coolly; &quot;and yet large sums must be
needed to help you to build machines. You must be rich. Are you rich?&quot; Vincent
grew a dusky red, and glanced in an odd way over his shoulder, as if he expected
to find some one at his elbow. &quot;Mind your own business,&quot; he said in a harsh
voice, and with suppressed fury; &quot;whether I'm rich or not is my business. You
shan't have an aeroplane of mine. Clear out.&quot; Dan did clear out, but as he went,
wondered why the man was so angry and confused. He seemed quite afraid of the
simple question that had been put to him.</p>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<h4>CHAPTER VII</h4>
<h5><a name="div1_07" href="#div1Ref_07">THE HERMIT LADIES</a></h5>
<br>

<p>Dan was not naturally of a suspicious nature, but since taking up the profession of a
detective, he had become so. Slight matters that formerly he would not have
noticed, now attracted his attention, and, as the saying goes, he saw a bird in
every bush. For this reason while returning slowly to the cottage, he considered
Vincent's backward glance, which hinted at nervousness, and his unnecessarily
angry reply to the question as to whether he was rich. Usually dreamy and
absent-minded, the turn taken by the conversation had awakened the tiger in the
man, and apparently he regarded Halliday as over-inquisitive. Yet why the
inventor should take this view, Dan could not conjecture. But after musing for a
few minutes, the young man began to think he was making a mountain out of a
mole-hill. And whatever secret Vincent had in his life, as his suddenly
aggressive attitude showed, it could have nothing to do with the particular
quest upon which Dan was bent. Halliday, therefore, dismissed the matter from
his mind with a shrug, and went into the cottage to disturb the lovers. &quot;Well,
Mr. Halliday,&quot; remarked Mildred, whose cheeks were flushed and whose eyes were
bright, &quot;what did my uncle say?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Very little, but what he did say was to the
point. He refuses to let me have a machine.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;How like him,&quot; ejaculated Laurance
quickly; &quot;but upon what grounds?&quot; Dan scratched his chin. &quot;Really, I don't know.
He seems to think that I am a spy desirous of learning his trade secrets. He
called you a meddlesome fool, Freddy.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Ah, that is because I wish to marry
Mildred,&quot; replied Freddy drily; &quot;it is very natural that Mr. Vincent should
object to a man who comes to rob him of his treasure, so I don't mind his
abuse.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I am not a treasure,&quot; cried Mildred, becoming pink. &quot;You are. Who knows
that better than I, my darling.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;You think too well of me.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Impossible. You
are the best and dearest----&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Stop! Stop!&quot; Mildred covered her face. &quot;Remember
we are not alone.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Oh, don't mind me,&quot; said Dan phlegmatically, &quot;I'm in love
myself, Miss Vincent.&quot; She nodded comprehendingly. &quot;With Miss Moon. Freddy has
told me.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Has he told you that my marriage depends upon my finding out who
murdered her father?&quot; questioned the young man dismally. &quot;Yes, and that you need
money for the search.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Which money,&quot; continued Laurance determinedly, &quot;must be
obtained by Dan winning this London to York race. That can be done, I am
certain, with one of your uncle's aeroplanes, Mildred, as he has made wonderful
improvements in their structure, and----&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;But he declines to furnish me with a
machine,&quot; interrupted Halliday in a vexed tone, &quot;not even my offer to share the
2,000 prize tempts him. He is too rich, I suppose?&quot; He cast an inquiring glance
at the girl. Mildred shook her head. &quot;Uncle Solomon is not rich,&quot; she replied
quietly. &quot;He must be,&quot; insisted Dan sharply; &quot;he could not indulge in such an
expensive hobby otherwise.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Mrs. Jarsell helps him with money, though, to be
sure, he has a little of his own. Still, unless she supplied money, Uncle
Solomon could not go on building aeroplanes, especially as he rarely sells one,
and wishes to keep all his inventions to himself. His idea is to invent a
perfect machine and then sell it to the Government, and he fancies that if he
allows any one else to handle his aeroplanes, his secrets may be prematurely
discovered.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Well, I can see his objection in that way,&quot; assented Dan, &quot;since
more ideas are stolen than pocket handkerchiefs, as Balzac says. But Mrs.
Jarsell?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;She is a rich and rather eccentric lady, who lives at The Grange,&quot;
said Mr. Laurance, before Mildred could reply. &quot;I am as wise as I was before,
Freddy. It's an odd thing for a lady to finance an inventor of flying-machines.
She must be large-minded and have a very great deal of money.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;She is
large-minded and she has plenty of money,&quot; admitted Mildred vivaciously; &quot;her
influence with my uncle is extraordinary.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Not at all if she supplies the
cash,&quot; said Dan cynically, &quot;but I have an idea, Miss Vincent. Suppose we enlist
Mrs. Jarsell's sympathies.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;About the murder?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;No,&quot; said Halliday, after
thinking for a moment or so. &quot;I don't see the use of talking too much about
that. The more secret Freddy and I keep our hunt, the better prospect have we of
success, since the gang will not be on guard, as it were. No, Miss Vincent,
introduce me to Mrs. Jarsell as a young and ardent lover who wishes to make
money in order to marry the girl of his heart. If she is romantic--and nine old
ladies out of ten are romantic--she will induce your uncle to, give me his
newest aeroplane.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;If she decides to help you, Uncle Solomon certainly will
give you what you want,&quot; Mildred assured him, &quot;since Mrs. Jarsell has supplied
him with so much money for his experiments.&quot; She thought for a second, then
raised her head cheerfully. &quot;We shall see Mrs. Jarsell and Miss Armour this
afternoon.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Who is Miss Armour?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Mrs. Jarsell's companion and relative and
confidential friend. She's a dear old thing, and is sure to sympathize with your
romance.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;All the better, so long as she can influence Mrs. Jarsell.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;She can
influence her, as Mrs. Jarsell swears by her,&quot; put in Freddy. &quot;Oh, I think
you'll pull it off, Dan. It's a good idea to work old Vincent through the hermit
ladies.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;The hermit ladies,&quot; echoed Dan wonderingly, &quot;an odd reputation.
Hermits are usually masculine.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Mrs. Jarsell and Miss Armour are an exception,&quot;
said Laurance laughing, &quot;in fact they are modern representatives of that
eccentric couple of ladies who lived at Llangollen. You remember them.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I have
heard the names,&quot; murmured Dan reflectively. &quot;The old ladies of Llangollen, who
eloped together and lived in Wales. I should rather like to see this pair that
follow so strange an example. When are we to go?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;This afternoon,&quot; repeated
Mildred, nodding brightly, &quot;I really think something may come of the visit, Mr.
Halliday. You and Freddy go back to 'The Peacock' for dinner and then call for
me later--say at three o'clock. I am a favorite with the hermit ladies and have
leave to bring any one to afternoon tea. Especially nice young men. Mrs. Jarsell
and Miss Armour are fond of young men.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Giddy old things,&quot; said Dan gaily. &quot;I
hope they will take a fancy to me, as I shall do my best to charm them. Well?&quot;
&quot;You must go now, Mr. Halliday, as I have much to do before taking an hour off.&quot;
&quot;Vincent works you too hard, Mildred,&quot; said Laurance impatiently, as he took up
his cap, &quot;you can't call a moment your own.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I shall call two hours or so my
own this afternoon,&quot; replied Mildred amiably, and sent the young men away quite
happy, since there was a promising chance that Dan would gain his ends. &quot;That's
a delightful girl,&quot; said Dan, when the two were seated at dinner. &quot;I should like
to marry her if Lillian were not in existence.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I'm glad that Lillian is, Dan,
since I want to marry Mildred myself. Don't poach, you animal.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I won't,&quot;
promised Halliday generously, &quot;I don't like dark hair. But it's no use arguing.
Let us eat and drink, for I have to fascinate Mrs. Jarsell and her bosom friend.
I'll get hold of that aeroplane, somehow.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;We are here for that purpose,&quot; said
Laurance, determined to have the last word, and as Dan was hungry he let him
have it. The Grange--at which they arrived late in the afternoon, the two men
escorting the one girl--was a large, rambling mansion built of yellowish stone,
its original color more or less washed out by rain and burnt out by sunshine.
The surface of the massive walls was grimy with black and rough with lichens,
while the broad, flat stones of the roof were covered with damp green moss. The
house, although in two stories, was of no great height, and stood on the
uttermost verge of the hill, which sloped abruptly down into the valley. The
view should have been very fine, but sundry tall houses had been built round The
Grange, which prevented the owner from enjoying the magnificent prospect. This
shutting-in--according to the legend--was due to the malice of a disinherited
brother in Jacobean times, who had created quite a village round about the
estate so as to block out the view. But the present inhabitants did not mind
much, for, as Mildred explained, both Miss Armour and Mrs. Jarsell stayed within
doors a great deal. &quot;In fact, Miss Armour is more or less paralyzed, and sits in
a big chair all day, reading and knitting, and talking and playing Patience,&quot;
said Mildred, as the trio turned into a small courtyard, and found themselves
facing a squat door, set in a porch sufficiently massive to serve for the
entrance to a mausoleum. An elderly maid, in an incongruous dress of brilliant
scarlet, admitted them into a darkish hall, whose atmosphere, suggestive of a
Turkish bath in a mild way, hinted that the house was heated by steam pipes, as
indeed was the case. There were some carved boxes of black oak in the hall and
three or four uncomfortable high-backed chairs, but the walls and floor were
bare, and the general aspect was somewhat bleak. However, when the visitors were
conducted along a narrow passage, ill-lighted and dismal, they were introduced
to a large low-ceilinged room, richly and luxuriously and picturesquely
furnished. The brilliant garb of the maidservant suited this room much better
than it did hall or passage, and there was a suggestion of tropical splendor
about the woman and the sitting-room, which revealed in Mrs. Jarsell a strong
love of color, warmth, and light. Indeed, although there were three large
windows looking out on to a garden, and immediately facing the door by which
they had entered, yet the light which was admitted being insufficient--perhaps
because of the wintry gloom--the apartment was brilliantly illuminated by six
lamps. Three of these stood at one end of the room, and three at the other, on
tall brass stands, and the light, radiating through opaque globes, filled the
place with mellow splendor. The vivid scene it revealed was a strange and
unexpected one to find in these barren wilds. What impressed Dan straight away,
was the prevalence of scarlet. The walls were covered with brightly toned paper,
the floor with a carpet of violently brilliant hue, and even the ceiling was
splashed with arabesque designs, blood-red against the white background. The
furniture was of black oak upholstered in satin of the same fiery tint, while
the draperies were of a dense black, funereal in aspect. A large fire glowed on
a wide hearth in a vermilion-tiled alcove, and the poker, tongs, shovels, and
pincers were of brass. Also there were brass candlesticks, a tripod of the same
alloy in which incense slowly smoldered and even brazen warming-pans of antique
pattern were ranged on either side of the fireplace. Thus, the general
color-scheme was of black, scarlet, and yellow. What with the barbaric hues, the
warm atmosphere, and the faint scent of incense, Dan felt as though he had
stumbled on the den of a magician, malicious and dangerous. But this may have
only been an impression caused by coming suddenly into this tropical room out of
the chill air and neutral-tinted landscape. Neither Mrs. Jarsell nor Miss
Armour, however, carried their love of violent color into their personal attire,
as both were arrayed--somewhat incongruously, considering the season--in
unrelieved white. The former lady was tall and bulky and somewhat assertive in
manner, with a masculine cast of countenance and watchful dark eyes. From the
smooth olive texture of her skin, she had probably possessed jet-black hair,
before age turned her still plentiful locks completely white. She was not, as
Dan concluded, more than fifty, as she possessed great vitality, and gripped his
hand in a vigorous, manly way, quite in keeping with her commanding looks. Her
white gown was made perfectly plain; she did not display even a ribbon, and wore
no jewellery whatsoever, yet her whole appearance was distinguished and
dignified. Indeed, when she welcomed the young people she assumed something of a
motherly air, but if the hint conveyed by the barbarically decorated room was to
be taken, she was anything but maternal. Mrs. Jarsell, as Dan mentally
confessed, was something of a puzzle; he could not place her, as the saying
goes. Miss Armour had also an unusual personality, being the antithesis of her
friend in looks and manner. To Mrs. Jarsell's massive assertiveness, she opposed
a fragile timidity, and was as small of body as the other was large. Her oval,
many-wrinkled face was the hue of old ivory, her features were delicate, and her
small head drooped in a rather pensive manner. Her white hair, not so plentiful
as that of Mrs. Jarsell, was smoothly arranged under a dainty cap of white lace,
decorated, oddly enough, with diamond ornaments. And, indeed, she wore enough
jewellery for both ladies; rings on her slender fingers, and chains round her
neck, and bracelets on her wrists, with a belt of turquoise stones, a ruby
brooch, and earrings of pearls. On a less refined person, this overloading of
ornaments would have looked vulgar, but Miss Armour, although she glittered at
all points like a heathen idol, preserved a calm dignity, which caused her
sumptuous display to appear perfectly natural. It was very strange that such a
mild-looking woman should deck herself out in this manner, so she, also, was a
puzzle to Halliday's intelligence. Indeed, the two ladies, in their splendid
room, suggested to Dan dreams of the Arabian Nights, and gave him the impression
of being concerned in some gorgeous romance. Miss Armour, seated in the big
chair which Mildred had mentioned, looked over Dan with mild, brown eyes, and
evidently approved of his good looks. &quot;I am glad to see you, Mr. Halliday,&quot; she
said in a soft and musical voice, quite silvery in its sound. &quot;To an old person,
such as I am, the young are always welcome.&quot; Dan felt called upon to pay a
compliment. &quot;You don't look old,&quot; he said bluntly. &quot;Well, now-a-days, sixty
cannot be called old,&quot; said Miss Armour with a pretty laugh, &quot;as I am assured
that women of that age actually dance in London.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;The age-limit has been
extended since Victorian times,&quot; laughed Laurance, who had seated himself near
one of the windows beside Mildred. &quot;Yes,&quot; assented Mrs. Jarsell, in deep tones
suggestive of a mellow-sounding bell. &quot;In those times, women went on the shelf
at thirty-five, and lived again in their children. Now-a-days, there are no old
people.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Certainly not in this room,&quot; said Dan courteously. &quot;You are Irish, I
should say, Mr. Halliday,&quot; remarked Miss Armour, smiling, as she resumed her
knitting of a red and white striped shawl; &quot;only an Irishman could pay such a
pretty compliment.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;My mother was Irish,&quot; admitted Dan amiably, &quot;and I made a
special journey to kiss the Blarney stone in the hope that it might oil my
tongue.&quot; Mrs. Jarsell in her heavy way seemed amused. &quot;You have certainly
accomplished your purpose, Mr. Halliday. But what does a gay young man, as I see
you are, do in this solitary neighborhood?&quot; and her keen black eyes swept over
him from head to foot inquiringly. &quot;Ah,&quot; put in Freddy quickly, &quot;that question
brings out the reason of our visit to you, Mrs. Jarsell. Behold in my friend a
lover.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Delightful,&quot; cried Miss Armour with great animation, &quot;and the lady?&quot;
&quot;Miss Moon, the daughter of Sir Charles Moon.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Moon? Moon?&quot; murmured Miss
Armour, as though she were invoking the planet. &quot;I seem to have heard that name
somewhere. Eliza?&quot; she glanced at her friend. &quot;Don't you remember the murder we
read about some months ago?&quot; replied Mrs. Jarsell heavily. &quot;It was much talked
about.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;It would need to be to reach my ears, Eliza; you know that I don't like
hearing about crime. In this neighborhood,&quot; she addressed herself to Dan, &quot;we
live a quiet and uneventful life, and although we take one London newspaper
daily, we know little of what is going on in the world. My friend reads to me
about the theatres and dresses, and sometimes politics, but rarely does she
inflict murder cases on me. I don't like to hear of crime.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I read that
particular case because it caused so great a sensation,&quot; said Mrs. Jarsell, in a
deprecating tone. &quot;You remember Sir Charles was poisoned by some unknown woman.
And now I recall the case, Mr. Halliday, your name was mentioned in connection
with it.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Probably,&quot; said Dan lightly, &quot;I am engaged to Miss Moon.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Have the
police discovered who murdered Sir Charles?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;No. Nor is there any chance that
the police will make the discovery. The woman came and the woman went after
doing her work, but she has vanished into thin air, like Macbeth's witches.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I
wonder why she murdered Sir Charles?&quot; asked Mrs. Jarsell, after a pause.
Halliday glanced at Laurance, and it was the latter who replied in a most
cautious manner, wishing to say as little as possible about the quest. &quot;The
reason is not known, Mrs. Jarsell.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;But, why--&quot; began Mildred, only to be cut
short somewhat impatiently by Miss Armour, who had been moving uneasily. &quot;Don't
talk any more about the horrid thing,&quot; she broke out impetuously, &quot;I don't want
to hear. Tell me of your love affair, Mr. Halliday.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;There is little to tell,&quot;
said Dan, relieved that the conversation was changed in this manner, since he
did not desire to say too much of his business in connection with the crime,
&quot;and I would not tell you that little, but that I wish to enlist your sympathies
and those of Mrs. Jarsell.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;You have mine already,&quot; declared the old lady
vivaciously, &quot;but why Eliza's?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Mrs. Jarsell can help me.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Indeed,&quot; said that
lady, looking at him hard, &quot;in what way?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Let me explain,&quot; chimed in Freddy,
impatient of Dan's slower methods, &quot;Mr. Halliday wishes to marry Miss Moon and
wants money.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;But she has plenty, Mr. Laurance. The papers said that the late
Sir Charles was a millionaire.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;So he was, and Miss Moon is his heiress,&quot; cried
Dan quickly; &quot;all the same, I don't wish to live on my wife, and so desire to be
in a position to offer her a home however humble. Now I am an aviator, Miss
Armour, and there is to be a race for 2,000 between London and York. I wish to
compete and desire one of Mr. Vincent's machines, as they are the most improved
kind on the market.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;They are not on the market,&quot; said Mrs. Jarsell frowning.
&quot;Mr. Vincent will not part with his machines until he perfects a masterpiece,
and then hopes to sell it to the Government. I don't wonder you failed to get an
aeroplane from him.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I did not say that,&quot; said Dan swiftly. &quot;Not in so many
words,&quot; rejoined Mrs. Jarsell deliberately, &quot;but I can guess why you want my
assistance, Mr. Vincent will give you a machine if I ask him.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;And you will?&quot;
said Halliday eagerly. &quot;Oh, Eliza, you must,&quot; put in Miss Armour quickly.
&quot;Vincent will do anything for you, since you have helped him so much with
money.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I shall be delighted to help,&quot; said Mrs. Jarsell, in her quiet, slow
manner; &quot;you shall have the machine, Mr. Halliday, and I hope you will win the
race and marry Miss Moon. But you are a bold man to offer to wed an heiress on
2,000. Don't you want more money?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I want heaps and heaps,&quot; said Dan laughing,
&quot;but I have no chance of getting it. However, two thousand will do to start
with. Lillian--Miss Moon, that is--loves me well enough to marry me at once,
even on the prize given by <i>The Moment</i>.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Well, Eliza, will get you the
machine, that is certain, Mr. Halliday. As to the rest, I have no doubt you will
be successful and win the money; but you must have much more in order to marry
Miss Moon, since I can see that you are much too honorable a man to live on her
millions. The cards&quot;--Miss Armour hastily put away her knitting and took a small
box from a drawer in the tiny table which stood at her elbow--&quot;my patience
cards, Mr. Halliday, for you know, having few amusements, I am devoted to the
game. Also I can tell fortunes. I shall tell yours,&quot; and she opened the box to
take out two packs of cards. &quot;Dan isn't superstitious,&quot; laughed Freddy, and
approached with Mildred. &quot;I don't know,&quot; said Halliday gravely. &quot;I have known
cases----&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Well, have your fortune told now,&quot; broke in Mrs. Jarsell, going to
the door, &quot;it will amuse Miss Armour to reveal your future while I see about the
tea. I am sure you young people must be hungry.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;But I haven't thanked you for
your promise to get me the machine.&quot; Mrs. Jarsell nodded in a friendly manner.
&quot;When you win the race and marry the young lady, you can thank me,&quot; she said,
with ponderous playfulness. &quot;Miss Armour will tell you if the Fates will be kind
to you in both respects,&quot; and she disappeared to get the tea, or rather to
instruct the red-robed servant to bring it in. Meanwhile, Miss Armour, her mild
face quite flushed with excitement, was spreading out the cards after Dan had
shuffled them. She used only one pack, and Freddy looked on at the disposition
of the colored oblongs with the deepest interest. Dan idly took up the unused
pack, and the moment he brought them near his eyes to examine them, he became
aware that there clung to them the same mysterious scent which Penn had stated
came from Sumatra. New as he was to the detective business, he yet had enough
sense to suppress his excitement at this discovery. Seeing that the ex-secretary
had stated very positively that no one but himself in England possessed the
perfume, it was strange indeed, that Dan should come across it in these wilds,
and connected with the personal possessions of a harmless old lady, confined to
her chair by partial paralysis. In spite of his coolness, he was so
thunderstruck that he could scarcely stammer a reply to Miss Armour, when she
asked him if his colored-card was clubs or spades. She saw his confusion
immediately. &quot;What is the matter?&quot; she demanded sharply, and her face grew pale.
&quot;The heat of the room, the scents, make me feel rather faint,&quot; said Dan
haltingly. &quot;Remove the incense burner to the end of the room, Mr. Laurance,&quot;
said Miss Armour, and when the young man did so, she turned to Halliday. &quot;Are
you, then, so susceptible to scents?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yes. I don't like strong perfumes. You do
apparently, Miss Armour. Why, even your cards are scented,&quot; and he held out the
odd pack. The lady took the cards and smelt them, but showed no sign of emotion.
&quot;I expect it's some scent Eliza gave me a few weeks ago. I had it on my
handkerchief, and it must have got on to the cards. Have you ever smelt a
perfume like it before?&quot; she asked suddenly. &quot;No,&quot; said Dan, lying promptly, as
he thought it best to be on the safe side, &quot;and I hope I shan't again. It's too
rich for my taste.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;And was for mine,&quot; said Miss Armour indifferently. &quot;I only
used it once or twice. Strange that you should be so susceptible to scents.
However, you feel better now. That's right. And the cards? See! There is great
good fortune coming to you.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;That's jolly,&quot; said Dan, now quite recovered. &quot;In
a few weeks,&quot; said Miss Armour impressively, &quot;a wonderful chance will be offered
to you. If you take it, a large amount of money will be yours within the year.
You will marry Miss Moon if you seize this chance. If you do not, she will marry
another person,&quot; and the fortune-teller gathered her pack. &quot;In that case, I
shall take the chance at once,&quot; said Dan promptly. Miss Armour looked at him
hard. &quot;I advise you to do so,&quot; she said briefly.</p>

<h4>CHAPTER VIII</h4>
<h5><a name="div1_08" href="#div1Ref_08">AVIATION</a></h5>
<br>

<p>The tea that followed the fortune-telling was quite a success, as Miss Armour was a most
amusing talker, and the rest of the party proved themselves to be good
listeners. The old lady, being an invalid, had ample time for reading, and
concerned herself chiefly with French Mmoires, the cynical light-hearted tone
of which appealed to her. But she was also well-posted in English literature of
the best kind, and could converse very ably--as she did--on leading authors and
their works. Dan complimented her on the knowledge she had attained. &quot;Oh, but it
is no credit to me, Mr. Halliday,&quot; Miss Armour protested. &quot;I have so much time
unoccupied, and grow weary of playing patience and of knitting. It would be
strange if I did not know something, after years and years of reading. Books are
my best friends.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Then Mrs. Jarsell is also a book, or say a human document,&quot;
said Dan politely. &quot;She is the best woman in the world,&quot; cried Miss Armour,
while Mrs. Jarsell bent her heavy white eyebrows in acknowledgment of the
compliment. &quot;You can have no idea how kind she is to me.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;And to whom should I
be kind, but to my old governess,&quot; said Mrs. Jarsell in a gruff way. &quot;Why, you
have taught me all I know.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;And I should think Miss Armour could teach a lot,&quot;
said Laurance in his pleasant manner; &quot;you know so much and have such tact, that
you should be out in the world governing people, Miss Armour.&quot; She sent a sharp
glance in his direction, as if to inquire exactly what he meant. Then she
accepted the compliment with a charming laugh. &quot;But for this dreadful paralysis,
I should, indeed, love to be out in the world. I love to deal with human nature,
and make people do what I want.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Can you?&quot; asked Mildred anxiously. &quot;Yes,
child,&quot; replied the ex-governess quietly, &quot;because I base my diplomacy on the
knowledge that every one, with few exceptions, is ruled by self. Harp on that
string, and you can manage any one.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Miss Armour,&quot; put in Mrs. Jarsell, in her
deep voice, &quot;rather talks of what she would do than what she does. Here, we see
few people. I go up to town on occasions, but very rarely.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;You must find it
dull,&quot; said Dan candidly. For some reason Miss Armour appeared to think this
speech amusing. &quot;Oh, no; I don't find life dull at all, I assure you. There is
always a great deal to be done, when one knows how to set about the doing.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;As
how?&quot; questioned the young man, somewhat puzzled. &quot;Books and music, and
card-games and knitting-work,&quot; said Mrs. Jarsell quickly, as if she did not
approve of Miss Armour's observations; &quot;nothing more.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Quite so nothing more,&quot;
assented the governess, but with a sudden flash of her brown eyes directed
towards her friend. &quot;Here we are out of the world. Do you stay long, Mr.
Halliday?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Only for another couple of days, until I can get the machine.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;You
shall get it, I promise you,&quot; said Mrs. Jarsell graciously, when the trio arose
to depart. &quot;Mr. Vincent owes me too much to disregard my request.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Of course,&quot;
chimed in Mildred. &quot;Uncle Solomon would never be able to build his aeroplanes if
you didn't help him with money. Good-by, Miss Armour.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Good-by, dear child. I
shall say <i>au revoir</i> to you, Mr. Halliday, as I shall expect you to come and
see me again, if only to let me know that your fortune has come true.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Will it,
do you think?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yes,&quot; said Miss Armour positively. &quot;I am quite certain that the
chance foretold by the cards will be given you.&quot; Dan hoped it would, and thanked
the lady for her happy prediction, after which he and Freddy, with Mildred
between them, left the weird house, and walked up the darkened road toward the
village. Halliday went at once to the &quot;Peacock,&quot; wishing to give Freddy and his
beloved chance of a <i>tte--tte</i>. They took it readily enough, as Laurance
escorted the girl home. It was an hour before he returned to an overdue supper,
which Mrs. Pelgrin served with fierce grumbling. After supper, Dan spoke his
mind to Laurance. &quot;When I took up that extra pack of cards,&quot; he said abruptly,
&quot;I smelt that same perfume that hung about Sir Charles's clothes when he was
dead.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;What!&quot; Freddy sat up aghast in his corner of the room, &quot;the perfume
about which Penn explained?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;The same. But did he explain? It seems to me that
he told a lie. If he only had one bottle, and the perfume is not procurable in
England, seeing it is manufactured in Sumatra, how did Miss Armour become
possessed of it?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;It may not be the same scent,&quot; said Laurance, still aghast;
&quot;you see a bird in every bush, Dan.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;This is not a question for the eyes, but
for the nose. I tell you, Freddy, that the perfume is exactly the same.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Why
did you not ask Miss Armour about it?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I did; you heard me. She got it from
Mrs. Jarsell, so she said. Now where did Mrs. Jarsell get it? From Sumatra?&quot;
&quot;Perhaps. Why not ask her straight out?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;No,&quot; said Dan decisively. &quot;I shall not
mention the subject to Mrs. Jarsell until I have questioned Marcus Penn once
more. He told me a lie once, by saying that no one in this country possessed
this especial perfume. He shan't tell me another.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;How do you mean to get him
to tell you the truth?&quot; asked Freddy dubiously. &quot;Never mind. I have some sort of
a plan. I shan't explain until it comes off. There is some connection between
that perfume and the crime, I am certain,&quot; concluded Dan, with a positive air.
Laurance wriggled uneasily. &quot;Oh, that is absurd. On such assumption, you suggest
that Miss Armour knows about the matter.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;About what matter?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;You know--the
gang.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Well,&quot; said Halliday, smoking thoughtfully, &quot;we are not entirely certain
yet if such a gang exists. It's all theory anyhow, in spite of the letters you
drew from this person and the other. Penn certainly explained the scent, but
told an obvious lie, since Miss Armour has it. I don't say that she knows
anything, but it is strange that she should possess the Sumatra perfume.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Other
people can send the same perfume to England,&quot; retorted Freddy. &quot;Penn isn't the
sole person who has friends in Sumatra. Mrs. Jarsell, since she gave the scent
to Miss Armour, may have friends in that island. Ask her.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;No,&quot; said Dan, very
positively. &quot;I shall ask no one until I make Penn speak out. In any case, I want
to know why he told a lie.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Perhaps he didn't.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I'm jolly well sure that he
did.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Then, to put it plainly--you suspect Mrs. Jarsell?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;To answer plainly, I
don't. There can be no connection between two harmless old ladies living in
these wilds and the murder of Sir Charles. Yet this confounded scent forms a
link between the dead man, Mrs. Jarsell, and Penn.&quot; Laurance rubbed his chin
reflectively. &quot;It's odd, to say the least of it. I suppose you are certain the
perfume is the same?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I'll swear to it.&quot; Dan rose and knocked the ashes out of
his pipe. &quot;And I intend to learn how Mrs. Jarsell became possessed of it. I may
be on a wild goose chase. All the same, with the stake I have, I can't afford to
lose an opportunity.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;So Miss Armour said, when she told your fortune,&quot;
commented Freddy thoughtfully. &quot;Yes. I wonder what she meant?&quot; Dan stretched
himself. &quot;I'm for bed. Ring the bell, and ask Mrs. Pelgrin for the spirits.&quot;
Laurance, not feeling called upon to resume the conversation, as he was tired
himself, did as he was told, and Mrs. Pelgrin, raw-boned and grim, bounced
aggressively into the room, to demand fiercely what they required. She sniffed
when whiskey was ordered, but as its consumption would increase her bill, she
brought in a bottle of &quot;Johnny Walker&quot; and a siphon of soda, without argument.
When she turned to depart, and wished them good-night in tones suggestive of a
jailer, a sudden thought struck Dan. It would not be amiss, he thought, to
question Mrs. Pelgrin concerning the hermit ladies. Not that he expected a great
deal to result from his exanimation, as the worthy woman was a she-cat, and what
she knew would probably have to be clawed out of her. &quot;We had tea at The Grange
to-day, Mrs. Pelgrin,&quot; said Dan casually. The landlady wrapped her hands in her
apron and wheeled grimly at the door to speak aggressively. &quot;Ho!&quot; she grunted.
&quot;What's that?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I said 'Ho,' and 'Ho's' all I'm going to say.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Well,&quot; drawled
Freddy with a shrug, &quot;you can't say much less, you know.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Less or much, I don't
say anything,&quot; retorted Mrs. Pelgrin, screwing up her hard mouth and nodding.
&quot;Nobody wants you to say anything,&quot; remarked Dan lazily, but on the alert. Of
course this speech opened the landlady's mouth. &quot;People say as it's queer two
ladies should live like dormice in a haystack,&quot; she observed significantly.
&quot;That's like people. They will meddle with what doesn't concern them.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Not me,&quot;
snorted Mrs. Pelgrin violently and epigrammatically. &quot;I don't say what I could
say, for what I could say wouldn't be what's right to say.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Wouldn't it?&quot;
inquired Freddy innocently. &quot;No, it wouldn't, sir; I'm not to be pumped,&quot; cried
Mrs. Pelgrin, &quot;try you ever so hard. So there!&quot; and she screwed up her mouth
tighter than ever. &quot;Who is pumping?&quot; asked Dan coolly; &quot;I simply remarked that
we had tea with Mrs. Jarsell and Miss Armour to-day.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Friends of yours, no
doubt?&quot; snapped the landlady. &quot;I never saw them before to-day, Mrs. Pelgrin.&quot;
&quot;Then don't see them again,&quot; advised the woman sharply. &quot;Thank you for that
advice. Anything wrong?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Wrong! Wrong! What should be wrong?&quot; Mrs. Pelgrin
became more violent than ever. &quot;There's nothing wrong.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Then that's all right,&quot;
said Halliday coolly. &quot;Goodnight.&quot; Mrs. Pelgrin stared hard at him, evidently
wondering why he did not press his questions, seeing how significant a remark
she had made. The idea that her conversation was trivial in his eyes hurt her
self-esteem. She gave another hint that she knew something. &quot;I wonder how those
ladies make their money,&quot; she observed casually to the ceiling. &quot;Ah, I wonder,&quot;
agreed Dan, making a covert sign that Freddy should restrain the question now on
the tip of his tongue. &quot;Three motor-cars,&quot; said Mrs. Pelgrin musingly, &quot;four
servants, women all and sluts at that, I do say, with a house like a palace
inside, whatever it may be to look at from the road. All that needs money, Mr.
Halliday.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Quite so. Nothing for nothing in this greedy world.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Ten years have
those ladies been here,&quot; continued the landlady, exasperated by this
indifference as Dan intended she should be, &quot;and dull they must find that old
house. To be sure, Miss Armour is ill and never moves from her chair--so they
say,&quot; she ended emphatically and stared at Halliday. &quot;So who say?&quot; he inquired
phlegmatically. &quot;Every one, sir. She's paralyzed--so they say.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;And Mrs.
Jarsell attends to her like an angel,&quot; remarked Dan suavely; &quot;they say that
also, you know.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Why do you advise us not to see the ladies again?&quot; asked
Freddy, who could no longer rein in his curiosity. Halliday was annoyed by the
question, as he thought it would dry up the stream of Mrs. Pelgrin's hinted
information. But instead of this happening, she became excessively frank. &quot;Well,
it's this way, Mr. Laurance,&quot; she said, rubbing her nose in a vexed manner. &quot;You
are two nice young gentlemen, and I don't want either of you to step in and
spoil George's chance.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;George?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;My nephew, he being the son of my late
husband's brother, and a porter at the Thawley Railway Station. Mrs. Jarsell had
taken quite a fancy to him, he being a handsome lad in his way, and the chances
are she will leave him a lot of her money, if you two gentlemen don't take her
fancy. Now you know my reason for not wanting you to see her again.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Oh, I
don't think Mrs. Jarsell will leave either my friend or me money,&quot; said Dan
affably. &quot;George Pelgrin is quite safe. I suppose one good turn deserves
another.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;What do you mean?&quot; said the landlady, sharper than ever. &quot;Well,
George Pelgrin must have done something for Mrs. Jarsell to make her leave him
money.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;He's done nothing, and she don't say she'll leave him her money, but
George thinks she might, seeing she has taken a fancy to him. I don't want you,
or Mr. Laurance here, to spoil my nephew's chances.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Oh, we shan't do that,&quot;
rejoined Halliday calmly. &quot;I suppose George finds it dull at the Thawley
Station, when there are no Sheepeak friends there with him. Working at the
station, that is.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Oh, he doesn't find it dull,&quot; replied Mrs. Pelgrin
innocently; &quot;he has made friends with plenty of Thawley folk. Are you going away
to-morrow?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Perhaps, and perhaps the next day,&quot; said Dan, wondering at the
direct question. &quot;You see I wish to get an aeroplane from Mr. Vincent, and as
soon as I do, I shall go back to London.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;You'll be seeing Mrs. Jarsell again?&quot;
Halliday shook his head. &quot;I shall be too busy to spare the time.&quot; Mrs. Pelgrin
drew a breath of relief, and again became fierce. &quot;I ain't ashamed of what I've
said,&quot; she declared, pulling open the door violently; &quot;you can tell the whole
village if you like,&quot; and she bounced out as she had bounced in, leaving
Laurance overcome with surprise. &quot;Now what's the meaning of all that chatter?&quot;
he asked, staring at Dan. &quot;Oh, it's very plain. Mrs. Jarsell has taken a fancy
to her nephew, and Mrs. Pelgrin thinks our fascinations may spoil his chance of
getting money. What I want to know is what George has done for Mrs. Jarsell to
warrant the deep interest she apparently takes in him. Evidently,&quot; mused Dan to
himself, &quot;there are not other Sheepeak people employed at the Thawley Station.&quot;
&quot;What of that?&quot; Laurance stared harder than ever. &quot;Nothing. Only George Pelgrin
would be the only person likely to know Mrs. Jarsell at the Thawley Station.
There are motor-cars also, remember.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I really don't see what you are driving
at, Dan.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I scarcely see myself, save that I want to learn the secret of that
perfume, and why it forms a link between Moon and Penn and Mrs. Jarsell.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;But
how can this chatter of Mrs. Pelgrin's help?&quot; asked Freddy, more and more
puzzled. Dan lighted his bedroom candle and walked slowly to the door before he
replied. &quot;I shall have to sleep upon what I know before I can answer that,&quot; he
said, nodding. &quot;Good-night, old chap.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;But Dan, Dan, Dan!&quot; called out Laurance,
who had heard just enough to make him wish to hear more, &quot;tell me----&quot;; he
stopped speaking, as he saw that Halliday was out of hearing. It was in a very
dissatisfied frame of mind that Laurance retired to his bed. Next morning Dan
had evidently quite forgotten the conversation of the landlady, for he made no
remark, and although Freddy tried to start the subject again he declined to
revert to it. Halliday declared that he did not know what to say, that he was
putting two and two together, but as yet could not make four, and that it would
be just as well to seek Mr. Solomon Vincent, to hear if he was disposed to
supply an aeroplane. &quot;Only I wonder,&quot; he remarked irrelevantly, as he walked up
the road with his friend, &quot;how it comes that Mrs. Pelgrin speaks more like a
Londoner than a Derbyshire woman.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I thought we discussed that question
before,&quot; replied Laurance. &quot;School-boards are doing away largely with the local
dialect. Also Mrs. Pelgrin, as Mildred told me, was in service for some years at
Reading. Why do you ask?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Oh, I ask nothing,&quot; said Dan easily; &quot;it was only an
idea I had.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Connected with the case?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yes, and with Mrs. Jarsell.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Pooh. You
see a bird in every bush, Dan.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;So you said before,&quot; rejoined Halliday drily;
&quot;why repeat yourself? Hullo, there is our inventor!&quot; he added, as they drew near
to the cottage, &quot;and, by Jove! he's smiling. Mrs. Jarsell had evidently spoken
to him.&quot; It was as Dan said, for Vincent received the young men with a sour
smile, which sat uneasily on his face, since he was more accustomed to frowning.
However, as he was disposed to be amiable, Dan was thankful for small mercies,
and expressed his feeling loudly when the inventor graciously placed at his
disposal an aeroplane of the latest construction. &quot;I owe Mrs. Jarsell much,&quot;
said Vincent, leading the way toward the shed, &quot;so her requests must be granted.
Here is the machine, Mr. Halliday.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;It's very good of you----&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;It isn't. Don't
thank me, but Mrs. Jarsell. Speaking for myself, I shouldn't allow you to have
the aeroplane,&quot; said Vincent sourly. &quot;I want to keep all my improvements to
myself until I make a perfect machine.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Oh, I'll keep all your secrets,&quot; Dan
assured him cheerfully as they entered the vast shed, &quot;and I'll share the prize
money with you.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I don't want it. Win the race and prove that my machine is the
best. That is all I ask. By the way, where is Laurance?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Don't you remember? We
left him in the cottage with your niece.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I don't want him to marry her, and he
shan't,&quot; said Vincent with a frown, speaking on the subject unexpectedly, &quot;and,
what is more, since he's a newspaper man, I don't want you to talk too freely to
him about my improvements.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Laurance can hold his tongue,&quot; rejoined Dan
somewhat stiffly; &quot;your trade-secrets are safe with him. So this is the
machine,&quot; he ended, to avert further discussion on the inventor's part. &quot;Yes,&quot;
said Vincent, forgetting all else in the passion of his hobby, and he began to
explain matters. &quot;A biplane, as you see, and it can carry enough oil and essence
for a twelve hours' flight. Wheel it out,&quot; he added, turning to a quartette of
workmen. &quot;Mr. Halliday will try a flight.&quot; Dan was only too ready, as the beauty
of the machine appealed to him immensely, especially when he beheld it in the
pale light of the sun, when it was brought into the open. The men wheeled it out
of the back part of the shed on to a level lawn, which could serve as a
starting-place. Vincent talked all the time in a great state of excitement, and
pointed out the various improvements and beauties of the masterpiece. The planes
were not exactly horizontal, since Vincent considered that he gained more power
by making them branch at a slight angle. The wings were doubly covered with fine
canvas, and a broad streak of crimson ran through their white, which the
inventor informed Dan was a characteristic of all his machines. &quot;A sort of
distinguishing mark, as it were,&quot; said Vincent. Another improvement was that the
aviator could steer with his knees on occasions, which gave freedom to the hands
when necessary. The engine was light and powerful, with tremendous driving-power
considering its size. Finally, the steering-seat--the bridge of the airship, as
it might be--was fenced in comfortably with aluminium, and a broad expanse of
mica protected the controller of the aeroplane from the force of the winds. It
was really an admirable machine and Halliday was loud in his praises, to which,
however, its maker paid little attention. Genius does not require laudation,
talent does. Dan inspected the machine in every direction, tried the steering
gear which ran easily, saw that the engine was well supplied with fuel, and
tested, as well as he could, the various spars and ropes and bolts. Then he took
his seat in the pilot-box, and prepared for a trial flight. &quot;Not that she hasn't
been out before,&quot; said Vincent, while Dan gathered his energies to start.
&quot;Ready, Mr. Halliday. Let her go.&quot; The workman ran the machine along the lawn,
Dan set the propeller going, and after lightly spinning along the ground for
some distance the aeroplane rose into the gray sky like an immense bird. A side
glance showed Dan that Mildred and her lover were running out of the shed, and
had arrived just a moment too late to witness his start. However, he had no time
to pay attention to terrestrial matters, for all his capabilities were given to
handling the new craft. Up and up he went to a considerable height, with the
engine running true and sweet, then dived nearly to earth in switch-back
fashion, only to tower again like a hawk. Shortly he was at a lofty elevation,
travelling along at top speed in the direction of the ten-mile-distant Thawley.
Vincent and his workmen, Laurance and the girl, became mere black dots, and
beneath him the earth slipped past at more than railroad speed. Once in the vast
spaces of the firmament Dan let his engines travel at their fastest, and the
vanes of the propeller spun, as an American would say, like greased lightning.
Halliday's pulses raced almost as fast, as the joy of playing with death seized
him. In the delicate structure of the aeroplane--being its soul and controlling
power--he felt like a bird and swooped in mighty arcs in proof of his mastership
of the sky. In a few minutes he was over Thawley, and a downward glance showed
him innumerable black insects running with excitement here, there, and
everywhere, as the machine was sighted. Dan dipped nearly to the weathercock of
the parish church, then slid out toward the northern portion of the town. Making
his aerial way with the speed of the wind Thawley was soon left behind and the
aviator hovered over a wide country dotted with villages, intersected with
streams, and rough with more or less high hills that divided the many vales of
the country. Ten minutes took him out of Hillshire, and he flew over the mild
Yorkshire moors. The air sang past him on either side of the mica screen, which
prevented his breath being taken away. Everything was taut and fit and neat, and
in its right place, and the engine sang a song of triumph, which mingled with
the droning hum of the screw. Below was the painted earth, above the gray sky,
faintly illuminated by the wintry sunshine, and between the two Halliday flew
with the swiftness of a kestrel sighting its prey. Dan was used to this sublime
excitement, and could control his feelings--otherwise he would have shouted for
joy, which would have been from his point of view, a mere waste of energy. He
finally reached York, circled round the Minster, and then turned his craft
homeward in glee. The machine was certainly the best he had yet handled, and he
made sure that given moderately decent conditions he would win the race and gain
the 2,000 necessary to continue his search for Moon's murderess. And the
capture of her, as he reminded himself, meant his marriage with Lillian. No
wonder the young man's heart beat high, for it was not easy to come by so
magnificent an aeroplane, and he felt as grateful to Vincent for building it as
he felt to Mrs. Jarsell for procuring him the mastership of the same. Those left
behind on the lawn behind the Sheepeak shed stared steadily into the gray
distance, and shortly saw a dim spot moving toward them with the swiftness of an
eagle. Larger and larger it grew, until they could distinguish the aeroplane's
construction, like a delicate tracery against the clouds. In a wide circle it
moved gracefully and then like a bird folding its wings, settled gently at the
very feet of its inventor. The trial was a complete success in every way.</p>

<h4>CHAPTER IX</h4>
<h5><a name="div1_09" href="#div1Ref_09">MAHOMET'S COFFIN</a></h5>
<br>

<p>The aeroplane acquired by Halliday could be
dismounted in three parts, so that it could easily have been taken to pieces and
packed for transfer to London. But the race for <i>The Moment</i> prize was to take
place within seven days, and Dan wished to familiarize himself with the machine
as much as was possible in the interval. For this reason he decided to go by air
to the metropolis, taking the journey in easy flights, with intervals of rest
between. He therefore arranged to send his baggage back to town with Freddy, and
carried only a small black bag containing absolutely necessary personal effects.
Freddy did not object to this plan, as he did not wish to leave Mildred sooner
than was necessary. Therefore Dan started and Laurance remained behind to pass
golden hours in the girl's society. However, he promised his friend to be in
London within two days. And as Halliday, besides covering the hundred and
sixty-odd miles in short flights, desired to practise aviation in the open
spaces of the country before getting to the capital, it was not needful for
Freddy to return to his business until forty-eight hours had passed. This
arrangement suited both the young men very well. Vincent, who was now as hot in
Dan's favor as he had been cold, presided at the start, and again and again went
over various details in connection with the machine, which was much dearer to
him than any child could have been. Now that his objections had been set aside
by the intervention of Mrs. Jarsell, the inventor was desperately anxious that
Dan should win the race, as such a triumph would undoubtedly show the value of
the new-fangled biplane. Not that Vincent wished for the money, or even for the
glory, but he very greatly desired to show other inventors that he was their
master. His vanity, being purely concerned with the result of nights and days of
meditation, could only be gratified by actual proof that he had conquered the
air. Not entirely that is, for Vincent was far too thorough in his genius to
believe that Rome could be built in a day; but, at all events, he trusted that
his machine would reveal itself as the best that any man had yet constructed. So
far as that was concerned, Halliday, accustomed to aviation, believed that the
sour old man had succeeded. &quot;If I don't win the race, it won't be your fault,
Mr. Vincent,&quot; Dan assured him, as he stepped into the pilot's box, and, with
this farewell speech, the inventor expressed himself very well content. He did
not expect impossibilities, and he saw that the man to whom he had entrusted his
darling airship was both cool and enthusiastic, qualities which go far toward
complete success. It was a calm day, with scarcely any wind, when Dan began his
flight, and as the biplane could easily attain sixty miles an hour he would have
had no difficulty in reaching London early in the afternoon. But he did not make
straight for the south, but circled gradually down to Rugby, where he proposed
to remain for the night. Dawdling in the air, it was five hours before he
alighted outside the town, and feeling weary with the strain on his nerves--for
the machine required dexterous handling--he determined to rest. Without much
difficulty he found a friendly farmer, who was willing that the airship should
be housed in an empty barn for the night. When all was safe and Halliday had
arranged that no one should enter the barn, he sought out a cheap inn on the
borders of the place to rest for the night, within watching-distance of his
craft. Next morning, after breakfast, he concluded to start again, but after a
visit to the barn to see that all was well, he returned to the inn for an hour.
It was necessary, he thought, to consider the situation and his future plans,
and he wished for solitude to do so. Owing to his fatigue, he had not been able
to think much on the previous night before sleep overtook him. The plan, which
Dan intended to carry into effect when he reached Town, was to force Penn into
confessing what he actually knew concerning the perfume. He had obviously spoken
falsely as to his being its sole possessor in England, since Mrs. Jarsell had
given the like scent to her old governess. Yet, why should Penn lie in this
fashion, unless there was some secret connected with the perfume, which he
desired to keep concealed. And assuredly the scent had clung round the clothes
of the dead man. Dan determined to force Penn into confession, and that could
only be done by frightening him greatly. To carry out this plan, Halliday wrote
to the man asking him for an interview, and when he came--as Dan was certain he
would--intended, in some way, to inveigle him into taking a flight. Once Penn
was in the air his fears could be played upon to some purpose. At least Dan
thought so, and was eager to make the experiment. Of course, the young man did
not suspect Mrs. Jarsell of being connected in any way with crime of any sort.
Still it was strange that the perfume from Sumatra should form a link between
her and Sir Charles Moon, with Penn intervening. It was also strange that Mrs.
Pelgrin should hint that Mrs. Jarsell had secrets. She had not said as much in
so many words, but the general trend of her cautious conversation went to show
that Mrs. Jarsell was not entirely open and aboveboard. The landlady had
wondered where the owner of the Grange got her money. Now why should she so
wonder, unless she had proofs that the said money was not come by honestly? And
why, also, should she, in a quite unnecessary way, mention her nephew, who was
the Thawley station porter--friendly with Mrs. Jarsell to such an extent that
there was a chance of his getting a legacy? Ladies of wealth do not make friends
of railway porters without reason, and Dan wished to learn the reason in this
particular case. By a diplomatic question he had ascertained from Mrs. Pelgrin
that her nephew was the sole Sheepeak person employed at the station.
Consequently he would naturally be the sole person who knew Mrs. Jarsell and all
about her; therefore it was not impossible that the lady befriended the man so
that he might not speak of her visits to town. Yet why should he not do so,
should Mrs. Jarsell's doings be entirely honest? Then there were three motor
cars, a quite unnecessary number for a lady to keep, especially as, according to
her own story, she went out little and spent most of her time in attending to
Miss Armour. On the whole, although his suspicions were vague, Dan had an idea
that Mrs. Jarsell's doings would not bear the light of day. Still--and
especially since she had procured him the biplane--he would not have troubled
about her rustic affairs save for the fact of the perfume. It might be--and this
he hoped to discover--that Penn's confession would show more plainly the link
which connected Mrs. Jarsell with the Hampstead crime. Yet, on the face of it,
the very idea seemed monstrous, and Dan scorned himself for his folly as he
wrote the letter to Penn. Nevertheless, something stronger than himself drove
him to post the letter. Afterwards, to get the unpleasant taste of conspiring
out of his mouth, the young man wrote a lover-like epistle to Lillian, telling
her about his capture of the aeroplane. &quot;You and Mrs. Bolstreath must come and
see the start of the race at Blackheath,&quot; wrote Dan, &quot;and your mere presence
will inspire me to do my very best to win. So much hangs on my gaining this
race, as I want the money to prosecute the search for your father's assassin!&quot;
Then Halliday left business for pleasure, and, telling Lillian that he adored
her to distraction, urged her not to see too much of Lord Curberry. Finally, he
declared that he was hungering for a glimpse of her angel face, and now that he
was returning to London intended to call and see her, despite the prohibition of
Sir John. There was much more passionate writing to the same effect, and the
letter ended with sentiments of lively and lofty devotion. If another man had
written the letter Dan would have smiled at its vehemence, since the scribe cast
himself under Miss Moon's dainty feet to be trampled upon. But as Dan was the
author of the epistle, he only regretted that he could not say more ardent
things than he had set down. To such lengths does the passion of love carry the
most matter-of-fact of men; and Halliday certainly prided himself upon being a
very up-to-date child of this materialistic age, believing in nothing he could
not see, or touch, or feel. The letters having been posted, and the bill paid,
and the black bag packed, Dan took his way to the barn of the friendly farmer.
He found quite a number of people before the great doors, as the news that an
aviator was in the neighborhood had spread rapidly. The farmer did not wish to
take any rent for the night's lodging of the aeroplane, but as it had been
guarded so carefully and was housed so comfortably, Halliday insisted on the man
having some recompense for his kindness. Then, with the assistance of three or
four willing onlookers, the machine was wheeled out into the meadow wherein the
barn stood. It was close upon mid-day when Dan started, and the spectators
gasped with awe and delighted surprise when the biplane, like a big dragon-fly,
soared into the cloudy sky. Willing to give them pleasure, since an airship was
not a common sight in the neighborhood, Halliday did some fancy flying, and
circled and dipped and towered directly over the town before finally waving his
hand in farewell. A thin cry of many throats came to his ears as he sped
southward, and he was delighted to find how readily the machine answered to
every motion of his hand. He almost felt that he was riding on a live thing, all
nerves and energy, so obedient was the craft to his will. The machine was like a
flying beetle, the planes motionless to sustain the body like the front wings of
the insect, while the propeller, spinning vigorously, acted like the back wings
to drive ahead. Dan had a faint idea of seeing some comparison of this sort in a
magazine, and wondered if Vincent, having seen it also, had constructed his
aeroplane on insect lines. But he soon dropped all conjecture to attend strictly
to his business, which was to reach London as speedily as possible; no very
difficult task, considering the swiftness of his vehicle. It was convenient that
Dan should know a shed at Blackheath where he could house his machine, as Lord
Curberry's house was in that neighborhood. Once on the spot it would be easy to
have an interview with Marcus Penn, and perhaps not difficult to induce him to
take the air in the loft spaces of the sky. The neighborhood was well known to
Halliday, for his occupation of aviation brought him often there, and he had
experimented with various inventions at various times, where the land afforded
room for the departure and arrival of the machines; therefore, when he reached
London's outskirts he made for Blackheath, and without difficulty brought the
aeroplane to earth, a stone-throw from the shed in question. It said a great
deal for the capabilities of the biplane that her pilot was enabled to strike
his destination so exactly. Of course, the usual concourse of people gathered
when the great bird-like structure fluttered down from the sky, but Dan sent a
messenger to the man who looked after the shed, and soon had Vincent's
masterpiece safely put away under lock and key. As he had been practising flying
and strenuously testing the qualities of the machine, it was quite five o'clock
before he was free to do what he would. As the distance from Rugby was just over
eighty miles he could have arrived much earlier had he wished. But there was no
need to do so, and every need to accustom himself to handling the biplane easily
in view of the great race. When Dan had given certain instructions to the man
who looked after the shed and was responsible for the safety of the machine, he
walked across the Heath to a comfortable inn, where he was well known, as he had
put up at it many times previously. It was here that he had appointed the
meeting with Marcus Penn, for the next morning, but so eager was he to come face
to face with the man and wring the truth out of him, that he almost decided to
walk to Lord Curberry's house, which was two miles distant. But a swift
reflection that he could do nothing until the next morning--since Penn had to be
coaxed on to the aeroplane and certainly would decline a night-run--decided him
to wait. The &quot;Black Bull&quot; was a particularly comfortable hotel and the landlady
supplied tasty dinners; therefore Halliday took the good the gods sent him and
settled down for a quiet evening. After a stroll to the shed to see that
Vincent's creation was all right he returned to the inn and went to bed. His
nerves speedily relaxed, and he slept deeply until nine o'clock in the morning.
As he had invited Penn to see him at eleven, he had just time to take his
breakfast comfortably, read the newspaper, and saunter; out to take the fresh
air before his visitor arrived. Marcus Penn had not improved in looks since Dan
had last seen him. His thin face was still yellow, his hair and moustache still
scanty, and he appeared to be as nervous as ever. When he sat down he looked
apprehensively at Halliday with his pale eyes, and passed his tongue over his
dry lips. It seemed to the aviator that Penn's conscience was not quite at rest,
else he would scarcely look so scared, when--on the face of it--there was no
need to do so. Dan, however, soon set him at his ease, which was the first
necessary step towards gaining his confidence. For, unless that was gained he
assuredly would not set foot on the aeroplane. &quot;How are you getting along, Mr.
Penn?&quot; said Halliday, genially. &quot;Have a cigarette and something wet? Oh, I
forget you don't drink so early in the day. I am glad you are up to time, as I
am just starting out on a fly.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Really,&quot; remarked the secretary eagerly. &quot;I
should like to see you make a start. Is your flying-machine near at hand?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;In
the shed over yonder, on the verge of the Heath,&quot; said Dan, jerking his head
over his left shoulder; &quot;but I daresay you wonder why I asked you to see me, Mr.
Penn?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Well, er--that is--er--I did wonder a trifle,&quot; hesitated the pale man,
and again looked anxious. &quot;It has to do with your literary ambitions,&quot; said
Halliday slowly. Penn flushed, looking both relieved on learning why he had been
summoned to the meeting and pleased that the subject should be of such personal
interest. &quot;What do you know of my literary ambitions?&quot; he asked doubtfully. &quot;All
that Miss Moon could tell me,&quot; said Dan, promptly, and this was absolutely
correct, as Lillian had long ago asked him to aid the secretary, although he had
never troubled about the matter until now. &quot;Yes, I certainly did tell Miss Moon
that I wished to become a novelist. I found her sympathetic.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yes, she would
be; she always is. I suppose,&quot; said Dan darting off at a tangent, &quot;that you are
comfortable with Lord Curberry?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Oh, yes,&quot; assented the man, cheerfully. &quot;I
have good pay and little to do, and Lord Curberry is very kind. I have plenty of
time to write my stories.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Have you had any published?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;No,&quot; sighed Penn,
sadly, &quot;I have tried again and again to get some short tales printed, but so
far, without success. &quot;Well, then, you know that I have a friend--Mr. Frederick
Laurance--who is on that newspaper <i>The Moment</i>. I suggest that you should send
me some of your manuscripts for him to read. If he approves of them he will see
what he can do, as he knows nearly every one of any note in the literary world.&quot;
&quot;Oh, you are too good. I shall be delighted. All the same,&quot; Penn hesitated, and
writhed, &quot;why should you do this for me?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;It is Miss Moon who is doing this for
you,&quot; rejoined Halliday, saying what was perfectly true; &quot;she asked me to help
you. I suppose she comes sometimes to Lord Curberry's house?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Oh, yes,&quot; said
Penn, with a swift glance at him, &quot;her uncle, Sir John, and Miss Moon and Mrs.
Bolstreath dined with Lord Curberry last week. I am afraid, Mr. Halliday,&quot; added
the secretary timidly, &quot;that you will lose Miss Moon.&quot; Dan laughed cheerfully.
&quot;I don't think so. Why should I?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Her uncle is very anxious for her to marry
Lord Curberry, who is also very desirous to make Miss Moon his wife.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;That
shows Curberry's good taste,&quot; said Halliday rising, and putting on his cap.
&quot;However, she is to be my wife, and Curberry and Sir John can go hang.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I
should not be so sure, Mr. Halliday,&quot; said Penn, in a mysterious manner, &quot;when
Lord Curberry wants anything, he generally gets it.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;He is crying for the moon
just now,&quot; said the other man making a pun, &quot;and the moon is no man's property.
However, I must go off to start for my flying practise. I am going to compete in
the London to York race next week. Come with me and see me start. As to your
stories, you can send them to me at my old address, which you knew when you were
with Sir Charles. I shall see Mr. Laurance about them.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;You are good,&quot; murmured
Penn, drawing a long breath and following Dan out of the inn. &quot;I am obliged to
you.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;To Miss Moon, you mean. She is the one who takes an interest in your
literary efforts. But come along and see my machine. I got it from an inventor
called Vincent,&quot; and Dan turned suddenly to shoot an inquiring glance at his
companion. It occurred to him that Penn might have heard the name since Penn had
the perfume as well as Mrs. Jarsell, who knew the inventor. But evidently Penn
had not heard the name, for he gave no sign of knowledge. &quot;I hope it is a good
machine,&quot; he said innocently and weakly. &quot;Very good,&quot; said Halliday, as they
halted near the great doors of the shed, &quot;a clipper. Why not try a fly with me?&quot;
&quot;Oh!&quot; Penn shrank back. &quot;I should be afraid.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Nonsense, man!&quot; joked the aviator
while the aeroplane was wheeled out, and the usual crowd of onlookers began to
gather. &quot;As a literary man you ought to experience all sensation so as to write
about it. Coming stories will be full of flying-machines and airships.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Isn't
it dangerous?&quot; asked Penn, looking at the delicate structure which appeared
almost too fragile to sustain one person, let alone two. &quot;Not at all, especially
if one doesn't do any fancy flying, which I shall avoid if you come with me.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I
should like to have the experience,&quot; hesitated the secretary, &quot;that is if you
will not fly too high or too far.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I'll take you across the Heath and back
again and will keep within a tolerably safe distance from the ground.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;It's
tempting,&quot; quavered Penn, wistfully, while Dan busied himself in getting things
square. &quot;Please yourself,&quot; rejoined Halliday carelessly, and satisfied that the
timid man was nibbling at the bait. &quot;I can't stay here all day.&quot; He slipped into
the pilot's seat. &quot;Well, well?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I really think I should like--where am I to
sit?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;In this place.&quot; Dan touched a spring and the pilot box of aluminium
lengthened out so that there was room for two people. This was one of Vincent's
improvements upon which he prided himself, as the vehicle could, by adjusting
the closed-in car, seat two people or one, as the need arose. &quot;But don't come,
if you feel the least fear.&quot; Those of the idle spectators close at hand grinned
at Penn's pale face, and he was stung into accepting hastily what he would have
rejected in a cooler moment. &quot;I am not afraid,&quot; he said, trying to steady his
voice, and with an air of bravado he stepped in beside the aviator. &quot;Oh, I say,&quot;
he gasped. And no wonder. Dan did not give him a moment to change his mind.
Having captured his prey, he intended to keep him, so set the engine going
almost before Penn was comfortably seated. In less time than it takes to tell
the aeroplane whirled along the ground swiftly and lifted herself gracefully
upward. Penn gasped again, and glanced down at the sinking ground, where the
spectators were already beginning to grow smaller. But the motion of the biplane
was so easy, and the face of her pilot was so composed, that after the first
thrill of terror Penn began to feel that flying was not such a very dangerous
pastime as he had imagined. &quot;Wonderful, wonderful,&quot; he murmured, as the great
artificial bird glided smoothly through the air, &quot;but don't--don't go too high,
Mr. Halliday.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I shall go high enough to smash you,&quot; said Dan, coolly. He was
circling in swallow flights round the Heath, now high now low, now swift now
slow, and had the machine so entirely under command that he was enabled to give
a certain amount of his attention, though not all, to his companion. Penn gasped
again, and his terror revived. &quot;Smash me! Oh!!&quot; he almost shrieked. &quot;Yes,&quot; said
Dan, not looking, since he had to watch where he was going, but speaking rapidly
and clearly all the same. &quot;I want to know the truth about that perfume. About
the Sumatra perfume you told me was possessed alone by you. That was a lie, and
you know it was a lie.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I--I--I don't know anything more about it,&quot; whimpered
the secretary. &quot;Yes you do. Out with the truth,&quot; said Dan relentlessly, &quot;if you
don't I shall drop you overboard to smash like an egg.&quot; Penn clung to his seat
desperately. &quot;That would be murder.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I daresay, but I shouldn't suffer.
Accidents will happen in aeroplanes you know. You are like Mahomet's coffin,
slung between heaven and earth, and overboard Mahomet's coffin will go in a few
minutes unless----&quot; Dan swerved the machine which tilted slightly and Penn went
green with terror. &quot;What--what--what do you want to know?&quot; he wailed, as the
biplane dipped nearly to earth, to sweep upward in a graceful curve. &quot;Who is
Mrs. Jarsell?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I--oh, Lord--I don't know.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;You do. She has this perfume also.
Has it anything to do with a gang?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yes, yes.&quot; Penn's teeth were chattering,
and the sinking motion made him sick. &quot;What has it to do with a gang?&quot;
&quot;It's--it's a--a sign.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Was Sir Charles murdered by this gang?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I don't
know--I don't know. Oh!&quot; Penn screamed and clutched again at the side of the
car. &quot;You do. This false Mrs. Brown belonged to the gang.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I can't say. I
daren't tell you. If I say anything I shall die.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;You shall die if you don't
say what I want you to say,&quot; said Dan between his teeth, and again the machine
dipped and towered. &quot;I'll tilt you out, I swear, if you don't tell me who
murdered Sir Charles.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I don't know, I tell you,&quot; cried Penn desperately, &quot;the
perfume has to do with a society of people, who--who--but I daren't speak. I
should be killed. I have said too much as it is. And if you reveal what I have
said, you will be killed also.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I don't care. Is Mrs. Jarsell connected with
this gang?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I don't know Mrs. Jarsell,&quot; said Penn sullenly, although his
terrified face showed that he was nearly frightened out of his wits. &quot;Do you
belong to this----&quot; started Dan, when a sudden action of Penn took him by
surprise. In endeavoring to frighten the man he had flown too low, and the
aeroplane was only six feet off the ground, preparing to swing skyward again.
The secretary, in desperation, flung himself sideways out of the machine, as it
curved at the lowest and fell heavily on the herbage of the Heath. Dan could not
stop to see if he was safe or hurt, but soared aloft again to a considerable
height. Circling widely he came sailing directly over the spot where the
secretary had tumbled out in his desperate endeavor to escape. Already the man
had picked himself up and was limping off toward the town as quickly as he was
able. &quot;Now,&quot; said Dan grimly to himself, &quot;he will have me arrested for attempted
murder. That's all right,&quot; and he chuckled, although not entirely successful in
his endeavor to make Penn confess.</p>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<h4>CHAPTER X</h4>
<h5><a name="div1_10" href="#div1Ref_10">ANOTHER MYSTERY</a></h5>
<br>

<p>In his anxiety to
learn the truth Dan was perfectly willing to be arrested on whatever charge Penn
might wish to bring against him. After all, publicity was what he chiefly aimed
at, and if he gave his reasons for threatening the secretary, he felt confident
that the man would find it difficult to clear his character. Certainly Halliday
had not intended to take Penn's life, and had not the man been such a coward he
would have simply laughed at the idea of being tilted out of the machine. But
his nerves, shaken by the possible danger, had given way, and he had said much
which he would have preferred to keep locked up in his heart. But that the
aeroplane, by dipping so low, had afforded Penn the chance of escape at the risk
of a rough fall, he would have spoken at greater length. And yet, after turning
the matter over in his own mind, Dan could not be sure of this. But this much
Halliday had learned. A gang assuredly existed, and the perfume was a sign of
recognition amongst the members, who apparently followed each other's trails by
scent. Penn declined to say if his late employer had been done to death by the
fraternity, but the perfume on the dead man's clothes answered this question
very positively. Also the secretary had denied that the false Mrs. Brown
belonged to the gang, a statement which was absurd, as undoubtedly she was the
emissary employed to bring about the death. Finally, the fact that Mrs. Jarsell
used the Sumatra scent brought her into connection with the Hampstead crime;
whatever Penn might say Dan felt that he had struck a trail, which would end in
the capture of Moon's assassin and the breaking up of a dangerous organization.
On reflection he concluded that Penn would have said very little more, even
though face to face with what he believed to be imminent death. He had hinted
sufficiently to show that revelation was dangerous not only to himself but to
Halliday, for if the gang learned that their secret was betrayed, it was certain
that death would be portioned out to the man who heard, as well as to the man
who spoke. On this assumption Dan felt confident that Penn would take no action
in the matter, and would probably hold his tongue about the adventure. If he
told any of the gang to which he presumably belonged, he would have to admit
that he had betrayed the secret of the perfume, in which case he would assuredly
be killed by his unscrupulous associates. The death of Dan, as the young man
believed, would follow, but he also believed that by taking care of his own skin
Penn would remove any risk of vengeance following himself; therefore he was not
surprised when he heard nothing from Penn, or of Penn during the days that
passed before the morning of the great race. Meanwhile he detailed the
conversation to Laurance. That young gentleman had returned to town with some
regret since Mildred Vincent was not by his side. But to assure himself of an
early marriage by securing a steady income, he flung himself into journalistic
work with redoubled energy, working night and day to gain an increased salary.
He was in his office employed on a political article when Dan presented himself,
and was not overpleased to give up even a moment of his precious time. In fact,
he grumbled. &quot;I wish you would come after business hours, Halliday,&quot; he said
testily. &quot;Oh, fudge,&quot; retorted Dan lightly. &quot;A journalist hasn't any business
hours. Like a king, he is always in harness. Why do you require me to tell you
such elementary truths, Freddy?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I have an important article to write.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Well,
then, you can write it in ten minutes or so. I shan't keep you long.&quot; Laurance
pushed away his writing paper, leaned back in his chair, and reached for a
cigarette. &quot;What is it, then?&quot; he asked resignedly. Dan paced the office and
related his adventure. &quot;So you see, old son, that the perfume is of great
importance, as I always suspected.&quot; Laurance nodded gravely. &quot;It appears so. But
if what you think is true, would the man have disclosed a secret dangerous to
his own safety?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;People will disclose anything when on the rack,&quot; replied Dan
with a shrug, &quot;and the aeroplane was my rack. The fool really believed that I
would tilt him overboard, and therefore said what he did say to save his
confounded skin. If he had not escaped so cleverly he would have admitted more.&quot;
&quot;I doubt it. From the hint he gave, if it was death for him not to confess to
you, because you could kill him, it was equally death for him to speak, if his
associates are prepared to murder him for babbling. However, we are now certain
that the gang alluded to by Sir Charles does exist. Undoubtedly he was got out
of the way since he knew too much.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;It is a pity he did not reveal his
knowledge to Durwin.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;He intended to do so, but was murdered before Durwin
arrived, as we know. By the way, Durwin is as keen as we are over this search. I
met him the other day and he said that he was hunting everywhere for evidence.
Why not tell him what you have learned, Dan? He can make Penn speak out.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Penn
won't speak further,&quot; denied Dan abruptly. &quot;I think, as it is, he dreads the
vengeance of his comrades.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Durwin belongs to Scotland Yard, and has powers to
drive Penn into a corner, so he may be able to force confession. I think you
should consult with Durwin about the matter.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;After the race then.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Why not
before the race, which does not take place for a couple of days?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I don't like
doing things in a hurry,&quot; said Halliday uneasily. &quot;I want to question Mrs.
Jarsell, and see if she knows anything.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;If she does, which is doubtful, she
will assuredly refuse to speak. So far, I see no connection between her and the
gang.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;You forget the perfume.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;H'm, yes,&quot; said Laurance meditatively,
&quot;perhaps you are right. I want to have more evidence before I can give an
opinion. But since Penn told you so much, aren't you in danger from the gang
yourself, Dan?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I think not. Penn, for his own sake, will hold his tongue. At
all events he has not moved so far.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;That doesn't say he won't move. I should
examine that aeroplane very carefully before the race, if I were you.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Oh, I'll
do that. I know the machine thoroughly by this time, and if it has been tampered
with I shall soon spot the trickery. Well, now that I have brought you up to
date with my information I shall leave you to work.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;One moment. Is Miss Moon
going to see you start for York?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yes. I got a letter from her this morning.
She and Mrs. Bolstreath come to the aviation ground with Lord Curberry, confound
him,&quot; and with a frown, Dan took his leave. He was anything but amiably disposed
towards his rival. Everything was quiet as regards the criminal business for the
next two days, as Penn made no attempt to punish Dan for the fright he had given
him. Halliday himself was much too eager over the race to trouble about the
matter, but he kept a sharp eye on the Vincent machine, still stored at
Blackheath, so as to guard against any tampering. The start was to take place at
Blackheath, and on the appointed day five competitors were on the spot
surrounded by a large crowd of curious people anxious to witness the conquest of
the air. Amongst those present was Durwin, who pushed his way to where Dan was
looking over his aeroplane. The aviator did not see the lean, keen-eyed man
until he was touched on the elbow. &quot;Is it all right, Halliday?&quot; asked Durwin,
nodding toward the machine. &quot;Perfect. She's a beauty, and it won't be her fault
if I don't lift York Minster before sunset. What are you doing here, Mr. Durwin?
I didn't know that you took an interest in aviation.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I take an interest in
this search for Moon's assassin,&quot; said Durwin drily, but in low tones. &quot;Laurance
saw me and related your discovery. I am looking about for Marcus Penn and intend
to ask him questions.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;He may be on the ground,&quot; said Dan, glancing around,
&quot;since Lord Curberry's place is a stone-throw away. But he won't speak.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I'll
make him speak,&quot; said Durwin with a grim look. &quot;Well, I hope you'll win,
Halliday. When you return to town look me up. I may have something to tell you,&quot;
and he moved away with a significant look. Dan could not leave his machine, or
he would have followed, as there were several questions which he greatly desired
to ask. The day was cold and dry, with few clouds, and a good deal of sunshine,
so the conditions for the race were fairly good. The wind was rather high, and
that vexed the aviators, as the art of flying is not yet so perfect as to
control the winds when they are over-strong. However, to go against these strong
air-currents would be an excellent test of the qualities of the various
machines. The start was to take place at one o'clock, and the competitors hoped
to reach their destination before five o'clock. Some of the aeroplanes could
travel at forty miles an hour; others at fifty, but so far as Dan knew, his was
the sole machine which could gather sixty-miles-an-hour speed. If Vincent could
be believed, the aeroplane ought to travel the hundred and eighty-odd miles, if
the conditions were tolerably good, in a trifle over three hours. Dan, now
having perfect mastery of the biplane, hoped to accomplish the wonderful journey
in a shorter space of time. But this hope had yet to be verified. Meanwhile,
having seen that all was in order, he turned to speak to Lillian who had just
come up accompanied by Mrs. Bolstreath. Lord Curberry was in attendance, and in
the distance Dan caught a glimpse of the yellow-faced secretary, looking unhappy
and nervous. &quot;Oh, Dan, I do hope you will win,&quot; cried Lillian, who looked
extremely pretty, but more than a trifle anxious; &quot;it does seem so dangerous to
fly in such a light machine.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;She's the best I have yet struck,&quot; Dan assured
her. &quot;Don't you think she's as perfect as Lillian, Mrs. Bolstreath?&quot; The elderly
lady laughed and cast a side-glance at Curberry, to see how he took Halliday's
complimentary speech. &quot;Well, I suppose you cannot think of anything prettier to
say. I have heard of a woman being compared to a gazelle and to a ship, but
never to a flying-machine.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Mr. Halliday is very up to date in his
compliments,&quot; said Curberry with a slight sneer. He was a tall, bilious-looking
man, with pale blue eyes and a thin-lipped sinister mouth, not at all
prepossessing in appearance, although immaculate in dress. Dan laughed. Being
confident that Lillian would never marry this spectre, he could afford to laugh.
&quot;We young people,&quot; he said with emphasis, &quot;go with the times, Lord Curberry.&quot;
&quot;Meaning that I belong to the past generation,&quot; retorted the other with a flash
in his pale eyes; &quot;you will find that I don't in some ways,&quot; and he glanced
significantly at Lillian. Mrs. Bolstreath looked nervous, but Miss Moon was
supremely indifferent. She did not care for Lord Curberry, and in spite of her
uncle's advocacy had not the slightest idea of marrying the man; therefore she
ignored him as consistently as she could considering the way he thrust himself
into her company. Without taking notice of this passage-at-arms, she began to
question her lover about the airship, and gathered quite a stock of information
before the start. Curberry being ignorant of aviation was out of the picture, as
the saying goes, so fumed and fretted and looked daggers at Dan. It took all
Mrs. Bolstreath's diplomacy to keep him in a moderately good temper. Luckily
Laurance strolled up, note-book in hand, as he was reporting for <i>The Moment</i>,
and greeted the party gaily. He knew Curberry slightly and nodded to him without
any word or salutation. In common with many other people, Freddy did not like
the man, who was by no means a popular character. &quot;Isn't it a splendid day for
the race, Miss Moon?&quot; said Laurance, casting an upward glance at the grey sky.
&quot;I look forward to chronicling Dan's triumph in <i>The Moment</i> to-morrow morning.
Well, old fellow,&quot; he slapped Halliday jovially on the back, &quot;are you prepared
for what Jules Verne would call the very greatest journey of the century?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;The
century is yet young,&quot; replied Dan drily, &quot;and it's only one hundred and eighty
odd miles I have to travel. Considering that aviators have reached a successful
distance of five hundred miles this race is a trifle.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Well,&quot; said Lord
Curberry, trying to be amiable--a hard task for him, seeing how much Lillian was
taken up with the hero of the moment--&quot;aviation has certainly accomplished
wonders since Santos Dumont took his flight of ten yards some four years ago.&quot;
&quot;Oh, you do know something about aviation, Lord Curberry,&quot; said Dan coolly. &quot;I
know that it is dangerous, Mr. Halliday.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Oh, Dan,&quot; Lillian grew pale, knowing
what the spiteful speech meant. &quot;I think flying looks more dangerous than it
is,&quot; said Dan with a reassuring glance, &quot;and Miss Moon has come here to be my
mascot.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;You will wire your safe arrival as soon as you get to York,&quot; said Mrs.
Bolstreath anxiously. &quot;Oh, every one will wire,&quot; cried Freddy, taking out his
field-glass, &quot;the telegraph offices will be kept hard at work all the night. As
sure as I stand here, Mrs. Bolstreath, Dan will be the richer to-morrow by
2,000.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;If he is safe, I shall be content,&quot; breathed Lillian, and she looked
as though she would have kissed Dan then and there, in spite of the presence of
the crowd and Lord Curberry. That unsuccessful suitor scowled, and was about to
make one of his acid speeches, when those authorities arranging the race came to
declare that all was ready for the start. Already the cinematographs were at
work taking pictures of the crowd and the machines and their various pilots.
Policemen drove back the throng to some distance, so that the aeroplanes might
have a clear space to run in, and just as the hour of one sounded the start was
made amidst a breathless silence. The aeroplanes ran along the ground like
startled hens, and sprang into the air at various points. The eyes of the people
from looking level now began to stare upward at the diminishing dots which
towered and raced for the north. A zigzag monoplane was leading, but Lillian had
only eyes for Dan's craft. Freddy gave her his field-glasses so that she might
get a better view. Three of the aeroplanes bunched, but two circled away some
distance in wide arcs, and of the two, one machine belonged to Dan. The
onlookers saw him increase the speed of his propeller and then, like an arrow
from the bow, he sped swiftly out of sight in a straight line. A cheer rose from
the throng, as the Vincent airship was leading by some lengths, and Lillian gave
Freddy back his glasses. &quot;I hope he'll come back safe,&quot; she said with quivering
lip. &quot;Of course he will,&quot; Laurance assured her. &quot;Dan is one of the most cautious
aviators we have.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;But there is always a risk,&quot; sneered Lord Curberry.
&quot;Probably. Only a brave man would take the risk.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;You don't fly yourself, Mr.
Laurance.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;As you see,&quot; was the calm reply, as Curberry's enmity was too paltry
to trouble about. &quot;Well, Miss Moon, we can't see anything more, so I suppose you
will go home.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Miss Moon is coming to luncheon with me,&quot; said Lord Curberry,
&quot;and Mrs. Bolstreath also.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I am very hungry,&quot; said that lady pensively, &quot;so I
don't say----&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Hallo!&quot; interrupted Laurance, as a clamor arose on the outskirts
of the now fast diminishing crowd, &quot;what's the matter? In the interests of my
paper I must see what is taking place,&quot; and with a hasty raising of his hat to
the ladies he left them to the care of Lord Curberry. As he pushed his way
toward the commotion he heard a voice asking if the man was quite dead, and
fancied that someone must have fallen down in a fit. But when he broke through
the ring of policemen, and beheld Durwin lying on the ground, with staring eyes
and a ghastly, expressionless face, the sight so startled him that he caught a
constable's arm. &quot;What's all this?&quot; he demanded hoarsely. &quot;Is Mr. Durwin dead?&quot;
&quot;Durwin,&quot; echoed the policeman sharply, &quot;do you know the gentleman?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Of course.
He is Mr. Durwin, one of the Scotland Yard officials. I wonder you don't know
that.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I never heard of him, sir. He must belong to the detective department.&quot;
&quot;What's the matter with him; has he had a fit?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;He's been murdered,&quot; said the
constable shortly. &quot;Murdered?&quot; Laurance stared at the man in a horrified manner,
and his thoughts flew to the gang which he and Dan and Durwin were trying to
root out. Was this another crime similar to that committed at Hampstead, when
Sir Charles was killed for knowing too much? &quot;Is there a fly on him?&quot; asked the
reporter hastily; &quot;see if there's a fly.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;A fly!&quot; The policeman evidently
thought the speaker was crazy. &quot;What has a fly to do with the matter? Here's the
Inspector, who was sent for some time ago. You had better speak to him, sir.&quot;
Laurance did so, and advanced toward the soldierly-looking official who made his
appearance. In a low and rapid voice, Laurance hastily explained that the prone
man was Mr. Durwin, of Scotland Yard, and also handed the Inspector his own
card. Meanwhile a doctor was examining the body, and found that the deceased had
been murdered by having a dagger thrust under his left shoulder-blade. He was
quite dead, and must have passed away almost immediately the blow was delivered.
The Inspector received this uncompromising statement with natural surprise, and
knelt down beside the corpse to verify the declaration. There was no doubt that
the medical man spoke the truth, for a stream of blood stained the back of
Durwin's coat, and had soaked into the ground. The thrust must have been made
with a very sharp instrument, and was undoubtedly delivered with great force.
&quot;Who knows anything of this?&quot; demanded the Inspector, rising and looking at the
awestruck faces of the crowd sharply. A slim lady-like girl stepped forward. &quot;I
was standing close to the gentleman,&quot; she explained nervously, &quot;and we were all
looking at the airships as they went away. I heard him give a gasp, and when I
turned at the sound, he was slipping to the ground. That's all I know.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Did you
see any one strike him?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;No, I didn't. How could I, when with the rest I was
staring at the airships going away. The gentleman was staring also, I think. But
of course I didn't take much notice of him, as he was a stranger to me.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I saw
him fall,&quot; put in a rough man, something like a navvy; &quot;he was crushed up
against me in the crowd, and I felt him tumbling. I heard him gurgle, too, and
heard this young lady cry out. Then I saw him on the ground, and pushed back the
folk, saying there was a cove dying. But I didn't think it was murder,&quot; ended
the man, shuddering. &quot;Nor did I,&quot; chimed in the slim girl. &quot;I fancied it was a
fit. I'm sure we were all so crushed up with the lot of people, that I shouldn't
have been surprised if he had taken a fit.&quot; This was all that could be learned,
and the Inspector took the names and addresses of the two who had spoken. There
were other people who had noted the man on the ground, but these were the sole
ones to see the fall. They had, as it were, almost caught the assassin
red-handed. But it was impossible to say who was guilty, for the throng was so
dense and every one's attention had been so earnestly fixed skyward on the
airships that no one could say who had struck down the unfortunate gentleman.
The Inspector was much impressed when he learned the identity of the dead man.
Once or twice he had received official letters from Durwin, but he had never set
eyes on him until he beheld him dead. But for Laurance he would not have known
who he was, and therefore questioned that young gentleman closely when the body
was carried by four policemen off the ground to the nearest place where it could
be placed under shelter. &quot;And what about this fly?&quot; asked the Inspector, who had
heard of the question from the policeman who Laurance had first addressed.
&quot;Don't you remember the case of Sir Charles Moon?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yes. The woman who killed
him was never discovered. I remember about the fly, and also I remember the
letters written to that newspaper of yours.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I wrote the first letter that
brought forth the correspondence,&quot; said Freddy quickly. &quot;Sir Charles had some
idea that a gang of criminals was in existence, and invited Mr. Durwin to his
house to explain. Before Mr. Durwin arrived Sir Charles was murdered. Since then
he had been looking into the matter, and I believe that he also learned too
much.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;You think that this gang you mention had him put out of the way?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yes,
I do, and that is why I asked if there was a fly on him. It's the trade-mark of
these devils, I fancy.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Well, there didn't appear to be any fly on him,&quot; said
the Inspector in an uneasy tone. &quot;All the same, I think your idea is right. Moon
was murdered because he knew too much, and Mr. Durwin has been got out of the
way for the same reason; at least I think so. However, we shall learn more
between this and the inquest. You will attend, Mr. Laurance?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Of course. I am
only too anxious to find out all I can about this dangerous gang. It must be
broken up.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;The breaking up will be attended with considerable danger,&quot; said
the Inspector in a very dry tone. Then he noted Freddy's address and let him go.
Laurance returned to the office of <i>The Moment</i> and hastily wrote his
description of the start for the London to York race, after which he saw the
editor and related what he knew about the death of Durwin. Permitted to write
the article dealing with the subject, Laurance gave a concise account, and
although he did not say too much, yet hinted very plainly that the death of the
Scotland Yard official was connected indirectly with the murder of Sir Charles
Moon. Remembering that Penn was now Lord Curberry's secretary, and that Lord
Curberry's house was near the aviation ground, Freddy wondered if Penn had been
amidst the crowd. Dan could have told him that he had been, but, at present,
Laurance did not know this. However, he had a shrewd idea that as Penn was
connected with one murder, he was probably connected with the other. Then Freddy
cursed himself for not having observed if there was any special perfume hanging
about the dead man's clothes. As he did not know the particular smell of the
Sumatra scent he could not say if it was the one Dan had traced to Mrs. Jarsell,
but if there was any scent at all, it was worth while looking into the matter.
To repair his negligence he finished writing the article--which was very
short--and then started for Blackheath to view the corpse again. As he was
leaving the office of the paper a telegram was put into his hand. It proved to
be from Dan, and had been sent from Bedford. &quot;Had an accident,&quot; ran the wire,
&quot;rudder broke. No bones broken, but shaken by fall. I return this evening to
town and will call. Halliday.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Now I wonder,&quot; murmured Laurance, when he read
the telegram, &quot;if that machine was tampered with, after all. If so, the gang
must be getting scared. First Moon, then Durwin, now an attempt on Dan's life.
By Jove, I'll be the next.&quot; The idea was by no means a pleasant one.</p>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<h4>CHAPTER XI</h4>
<h5><a name="div1_11" href="#div1Ref_11">ON THE TRAIL</a></h5>
<br>

<p>When Dan, looking rather pale and sick, presented himself at <i>The
Moment</i> office late that same evening, the first question Laurance put to him
was relative to the accident. &quot;Was your machine tampered with?&quot; asked Freddy in
a breathless manner, and the second almost the door was closed. &quot;No, it wasn't,&quot;
replied Halliday, sinking with a tired sigh into the nearest chair. &quot;I was
making a quick turn and the rudder gave way; I put too great a strain on it, and
came fluttering to the ground like a shot partridge. That was a few miles beyond
Bedford. However, I had the aeroplane dismounted and packed away in a village
close at hand, then after a rest caught the express to St. Pancras. You got my
wire?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yes, and I fancied this tumble must be the work of the gang.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Not a bit
of it. My bad flying, that's all. Well, I have lost the race, and the man who
flew the Zigzag monoplane has won, though he took his own time in arriving at
York. A dashed bad machine I think he had, even though it's come out top for the
time being. I'm a bit shaken, and feel sick, but a night's rest will put me
square.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Why didn't you go straight home and get it?&quot; inquired Freddy
anxiously, for there was no denying that Dan looked considerably fagged. &quot;I read
about this death of Durwin in a late edition of an evening paper, and couldn't
rest until I knew the truth. The paper only gave a hint. Tell me what you know.&quot;
Laurance did so, and then handed Halliday a proof of his article on the subject
which was to appear in the morning issue of <i>The Moment</i>. He supplemented the
same with further information. &quot;I went down to see if there was any scent on the
clothes of the corpse,&quot; he explained, &quot;it's still at Blackheath, you know, in
charge of the Inspector. There's no perfume, anyhow.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;And no fly?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;No. I asked
that the moment I saw Durwin stretched out on the ground. If this crime is the
work of the gang, the sign-manual is absent.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;All the same it is the work of
the gang, I truly believe,&quot; remarked Dan in grim tones. &quot;Durwin has been on the
hunt, and very probably, since he discovered the death of Moon first of all, he
has been watched. One of the gang got behind him in the crowd, and knifed him in
the crush. It would be perfectly easy for the assassin to slip away, without
being noticed, since every one was watching the flight of the aeroplanes.&quot;
Laurance nodded. &quot;I agree with you. But who is the assassin?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Well,&quot; said Dan
reflectively, &quot;I saw Penn on the ground.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;The deuce you did,&quot; cried Freddy
jumping up, &quot;did he----&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Don't be in too great a hurry. He seems to me much too
nervous a man to handle this job.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;But he belongs to the gang,&quot; insisted
Laurance sharply. &quot;He has as good as admitted that much by what he said of the
perfume.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Oh, yes, I believe he has something to do with the association,
which, by the way, appears to be a kind of joint-stock company, like that one
mentioned by Balzac in his story 'Histoire des Treize,' and----&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Oh, hang your
literary references,&quot; interrupted Freddy, anxiously pacing the office, &quot;do you
believe that Penn struck the blow?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;No, I don't. The gang must have better men
than he to strike.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Or women,&quot; muttered Laurance, thinking of the false Mrs.
Brown. &quot;However, since Penn was in the crowd, and is plainly in the secret of
the gang, don't you think we ought to tell the Blackheath Inspector about the
matter, and also Inspector Tenson, who had charge of the Hampstead crime?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;No,&quot;
said Dan, after a pause. &quot;If Penn is arrested and questioned, he will say
nothing. As he hinted, he would be killed if he gave away the gang; so as he
wouldn't split, when I threatened him on the aeroplane, he certainly won't speak
out if questioned by the police. And we haven't got enough evidence to prove his
complicity, remember. Better keep silence, Freddy, and let the police fog out
this crime alone. Meanwhile, we can look round and keep an eye on Penn.&quot; After
some argument, Laurance agreed to act as his friend suggested. It was no doubt
the wiser course to take no action until absolute proof could be procured that
the secretary was a member of the gang. Also, if Penn were arrested, the
organization might break up and scatter out of sheer alarm, in which case all
the villains would not be caught. Dan deemed it best to work quietly until the
whole of the scoundrels could be netted, and to do so it was necessary to
preserve silence. Thus it came about that, at the inquest on Durwin, nothing
came to light likely to connect this crime with the preceding one. The hint
given by Freddy in <i>The Moment</i> was not taken, and, indeed, was laughed at.
There was neither perfume nor fly on the corpse of the unfortunate man, and
consequently no link between Blackheath and Hampstead. An open verdict was
brought in, and Durwin was buried without the truth becoming known in any
detail. Then a new sensation took up the attention of the public. Nevertheless,
both Dan and his friend were convinced that Darwin, having learned too much, had
been done to death by the gang for its own safety in the same way as Sir Charles
Moon had been put out of the way. They employed a private detective to watch
Penn, but gave him no hint that they suspected him in any way. Through Penn, who
was the sole person they knew for certain--and on the evidence of the perfume
was connected with the gang--they hoped to arrive at the truth, but the time was
not yet ripe for questioning him as regarded his nefarious doings. But they kept
him well in sight so as to watch the path he took in life. There was no doubt
that by following the same they would arrive at a gathering of the dangerous
persons, whose association threatened to disintegrate society. As Dan, quoting
Balzac's fiction, had observed, it was Ferragus and his fellow-conspirators in a
modern setting. Dan, having lost the race, and consequently the 2,000, was
short of funds, and Laurance not being rich could not lend him any money.
However, the two managed to borrow a certain sum from a grasping money-lender,
which supplied the sinews of war for the time being. Halliday had the Vincent
aeroplane brought to Blackheath again, and made some money in his usual way by
taking various people trips for short distances. Aviation was now quite a
Society craze, especially for ladies desirous of a new sensation, so Dan did
extremely well. A few months later he intended to attempt a cross-Channel
flight, for which a French millionaire was offering a large prize, but in the
meantime he got along as best he could. Nothing happened for a week or two
likely to stir up the muddy water which concealed the doings of the gang, and
there were no new murders. Then Dan took Lillian to a cinematograph exhibition,
and made a discovery. Of course Lillian was profoundly grieved that her lover
should have lost the race, but comforted herself with the reflection that he was
safe. Had she been able, she would have interdicted Dan from trying further
flights, especially in the face of the many accidents which were occurring in
connection with aviation all over the world. Dan, however, laughed at her fears,
and insisted upon continuing his dangerous vocation. Nevertheless, he promised
in a moment of tenderness, to give up aviation when he and Lillian were married,
though at present affairs in this direction did not look bright. As yet Dan had
discovered very little likely to lead to the detection of Moon's assassin, and
until that individual was brought to justice, Sir John would never consent to
the match. The course of true love in these dark days was by no means running as
smoothly as the pair desired. Lord Curberry haunted Sir John Moon's house, and
pestered Lillian with undesired attentions until she was openly rude to him. But
this did not at all damp his ardor; he merely smiled acidly and continued to
send flowers and theatre seats, and lastly articles of jewelry, which she
declined to accept. And always Sir John was at her elbow, croaking out what a
lucky girl she was to attract the attention of the peer. With her money and his
title, to say nothing of his talents, the marriage would be an ideal one.
Lillian did not think so, and with the obstinacy of a woman in love with the
wrong person, preferred to think of and long for Dan Halliday. More than that,
with the connivance of Mrs. Bolstreath, who was heart and soul with the poor
suitor, Lillian contrived to meet him at various times, and enjoy herself not a
little. On these occasions they were like children let loose from an over-severe
nursery. Sometimes Mrs. Bolstreath came as chaperon, and sometimes, knowing that
Dan was a gentleman, she allowed them to be together alone, which, naturally,
they liked much better. But on the whole, and so that no one might talk, the
good-natured smiling woman followed their restless footsteps to restaurants and
theatres--matinees that is--even to cinematographs. It was at one of these last
entertainments that Dan received a shock. On this particular occasion, Mrs.
Bolstreath was not with them, as she had gone shopping in Regent Street. An
appointment had been made by her to meet Lillian and Dan at five, when the trio
intended to have afternoon-tea in New Bond Street. Meantime, as it was only
three o'clock, the lovers had the whole of London to themselves. The day was
rather fine, so Lillian proposed to go to the unfashionable spaces of the park,
where she was not likely to meet with any acquaintance. Dan was willing, and
they walked along Piccadilly in a leisurely manner. Then Lillian stumbled on a
biograph theatre, and read the programme. When she saw that a set of pictures
represented the aviation ground at Blackheath, and the start for the London to
York race, nothing would serve her whim, but that she must go in and see the
film. Dan was willing to oblige her, as he also was curious to see himself in a
moving-picture. Therefore, they soon found themselves being guided by an
attendant with an electric-torch, through the warm darkness of the hall to a
couple of well-cushioned seats. The performance was a continuous one, the
pictures repeating themselves again and again, so the lovers arrived in the
middle of an interesting story of which they did not know the beginning. Anxious
to see what had gone before, Lillian exacted a promise from her complaisant
swain that they should wait until the repetition. Dan agreed, but reminded her
that this delay would mean no walk in the park. &quot;Never mind,&quot; said Lillian,
slipping her hand into his, under cover of the friendly twilight, &quot;we can stay
here until we meet Bolly in New Bond Street; you know I adore cinematographs.&quot;
&quot;And me also I hope,&quot; insinuated Dan, to which the answer was a friendly and
very emphatic squeeze. As is usual with such entertainments the pictures were a
mixture of comedy and tragedy, so as not to dwell too long on one note. But
Lillian, in an impatient mood, waited anxiously for the aviation scenes. These
were in due time thrown on the screen, and the girl gave a little cry of
pleasure when she saw Dan tinkering at his aeroplane, every gesture being
faithfully reproduced. Halliday himself was greatly amused by this resurrection
of his doings and felt an odd feeling at coming face to face with himself in
this way. But he started, greatly surprised, for in front of the crowd and
disproportionately large, in comparison with the rest of the figures, he beheld
the massive form of Mrs. Jarsell moving across the illuminated picture. She even
paused to look round at someone in the mob, so he had a distinct front view of
her powerful face. There could be no mistake, as she was a singularly noticeable
woman, and when she finally passed away from the screen, he sat wondering at the
odd chance which had shown him that she had been on the Blackheath aviation
ground on the very day and about the very time Durwin had met with his
mysterious death. Her presence suggested the possession of the Sumatra scent
perfume, which in its turn recalled Penn's ownership of the same, and the scent
of the dead Sir Charles Moon's clothes. More than ever Dan was convinced that
Mrs. Jarsell was connected with the gang, and therefore with the two tragedies
which were perplexing justice. He was glad that he had promised to wait for the
repetition, and when Lillian wished to go, after she had seen the start of the
picture, which had met them half-finished on their entrance, Dan urged her to
stop and witness the aviation scenes once more. &quot;It is so amusing to see one's
self in this way,&quot; said Dan artfully. Lillian pouted. &quot;I wish I could have been
taken also,&quot; she said with a sigh of pleasure, and willingly consented to wait.
The second view convinced Halliday absolutely that he was right. It was Mrs.
Jarsell who moved so royally across the screen, and what puzzled him was that
she appeared to be well dressed, without any attempt at disguise. Yet, if she
had come to Blackheath bent upon crime, she would surely have worn a veil, so as
not to be noticed. Still, Mrs. Jarsell, living a secluded life at Sheepeak,
would not be known to any one in London, and might not think it necessary to
disguise herself in any way. Moreover, if by chance she was recognized through
any possible disguise, such a thing would mean the asking of leading questions.
However, there was no doubt that she had been on the aviation ground when Durwin
was murdered, and Dan determined to go that same night to Sheepeak and make
inquiries. He was very silent when at the afternoon tea with the ladies, but
Lillian chattered enough for two, and gave Mrs. Bolstreath a vivid account of
the animated pictures. The companion certainly did hint that Halliday was not
quite himself, but he averted further inquiries by saying that he had a
headache. Then he took leave of the pair, and went to see what train he could
catch to Thawley, being in so great a hurry that he did not even call on Freddy
Laurance to acquaint him with his wonderful discovery. Thus Halliday most
unexpectedly found himself standing on the Thawley Station platform, a few
minutes after nine o'clock, as he had left St. Pancras by the six o'clock
express. It was now too late to travel by the local to Beswick, for when he
reached that place there was the long hill to climb to Sheepeak, and The Peacock
Hotel would probably be closed by the time he got to his destination. Dan
therefore decided to remain in Thawley for the night, and secured a bed at an
hotel near the station. Early next morning he came to look for George Pelgrin
with whom he wished to talk, and had no difficulty in finding him. A
brother-porter brought the man to him and handing over his bag, Halliday
requested to be led to the platform whence the Beswick local departed. Then he
began to ask artful questions. Pelgrin was a big bovine creature, with sleepy
blue eyes, and a slow, ponderous manner, which argued small intelligence. Dan
wondered why a clever woman like Mrs. Jarsell should interest herself in such a
creature, and to find out cautiously introduced the lady's name. &quot;I was staying
at your aunt's hotel in Sheepeak some time ago,&quot; said Dan, as George carried his
bag over the bridge, &quot;and she told me that you are quite a favorite with my
friend, Mrs. Jarsell of The Hall.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Aye,&quot; grinned George amiably, &quot;that I be,
sir. I come from Sheepeak, and Mrs. Jarsell she takes interest in Sheepeak folk.
'Send for George,' she says, when coming to London, and I puts her straight as
she likes.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;She comes to town pretty often I expect,&quot; said Halliday lightly,
&quot;which is all the better for your pocket.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Why, no,&quot; said Pelgrin thoughtfully,
&quot;she don't go away much from Sheepeak, not even to come to Thawley. Once in a
few months she goes to London to see things. 'George,' she says, 'I'm going to
look up friends,' or 'George, I'm after lawyer's business this day,' she says.
Oh, she's good to me and Aunt Marian, is Mrs. Jarsell. I wish she'd come to
London oftener,&quot; ended George in dismal tones, &quot;for she gives me half-a-crown
always, and don't come as often as I'd like, seeing as I wants money.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Ah,
she's a stay-at-home,&quot; commented Halliday. &quot;Looking after that friend of hers,
Miss Armour, she is,&quot; agreed George. &quot;Well, she has been a good friend to me,&quot;
said the other man, shuffling into a first-class compartment, &quot;for she got me an
aeroplane from Mr. Vincent.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Aye,&quot; said Pelgrin, &quot;I know him. Crosspatch he is,
sir.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I think so, too. But Mrs. Jarsell promised to come to London and see me
in the London to York race. You heard of it, I suppose.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Aye, that I did,&quot; said
Pelgrin, and mentioned the exact date, &quot;we'd a heap of traffic that day, folk
going to York to see them airships arrive. But Mrs. Jarsell wasn't one of them,
sir.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;She wouldn't go to York, but to London.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;She didn't go nowhere,&quot; said
George doggedly, &quot;on that day anyhow. 'Send for George,' she always says, and on
the day of that flying-race send for me she did not. So she stayed at home, I
reckon.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Oh,&quot; Dan looked disappointed. &quot;I did so want her to see me flying in
this race, Pelgrin, since she got Mr. Vincent to give me the aeroplane.&quot; '&quot;Well,
she didn't see you, sir, for she never went to London on that day early or late,
I swear. She don't go much away from Sheepeak, and hasn't been there--to London
that is, sir--for months. And she always tips me half a crown,&quot; ended George
once more. Dan took the hint and handed over the money. &quot;There you are. And I
hope Mrs. Jarsell will travel oftener so that you may become rich.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Aye, I need
money, me being engaged as it were,&quot; said Pelgrin with a grin, touching his
forelock, and he went on explaining his private affairs, which had to do with a
girl, until the train steamed out of the station. Dan was puzzled. According to
the cinematograph Mrs. Jarsell had certainly been in town on the day of the
race, yet this yokel swore that she had not travelled from the Thawley Station.
Yet there was no other route by which she could come. Of course, according to
Mrs. Pelgrin, the woman owned three motors and could go to London in that way.
There was just a chance that she might have done so, but Dan did not know how he
was to find out. It would be no use asking Mrs. Jarsell, as she would deny
having been out of Sheepeak. Yet since she was wholly undisguised on the
Blackheath ground, why should she deny her identity. It might be that she would
admit having gone to the big city--say by motor--and would defy him to credit
her with the death of Durwin. Not that Dan would be foolish enough to accuse her
of the same, as he had no evidence to go upon, save the fact of the perfume, and
that was a weak reed upon which to lean. Mrs. Pelgrin might know something,
however, and to Mrs. Pelgrin he determined to apply for information. At the end
of his journey, and when he arrived in a ramshackle fly, he was welcomed by her
as usual--that is, she bounced out of the inn, and placing her arms akimbo,
smiled grimly. &quot;Oh, so you are here again,&quot; she said in exactly the same way in
which she had greeted Laurance. &quot;Yes,&quot; said Halliday, readily having his excuse
cut and dried, &quot;I lost the flying race, and have come to apologize to Mr.
Vincent for misusing his machine. I only want a mid-day meal as I leave again
this afternoon.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;You shall have your dinner,&quot; snapped Mrs. Pelgrin, leading the
way into the inn after Dan had arranged for the driver of the trap to wait for
three or four hours. &quot;So you didn't win that race. Aye, Mr. Vincent will be rare
mad with you, thinking what he does of those kites he makes.&quot; Halliday sat down
in the well-remembered room and laughed. &quot;The fortune of war, Mrs. Pelgrin. But
I am sorry I lost the race. Mrs. Jarsell, who got me the aeroplane, will also be
disappointed. Did she tell you about the start?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Eh! man, would a lady like her
come chattering to a humble body like me,&quot; was the landlady's reply, as she laid
the table rapidly, &quot;not that she saw the race, mind you, Mr. Halliday.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Oh, but
she must have,&quot; replied Dan, with pretended surprise, &quot;she promised to come and
see me start from Blackheath.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;She did not go to London,&quot; persisted Mrs.
Pelgrin, her eyes becoming angry at the contradiction, &quot;I mind that well,
because she came to see me about some eggs on the very day you were flying, and
says she, 'It will be a good day for Mr. Vincent's machine to win the race.'&quot;
&quot;Are you sure?&quot; asked Dan, more puzzled than ever to find that the stories of
Mrs. Pelgrin and her nephew were in accordance with one another. &quot;Do you take me
for a fool,&quot; cried Mrs. Pelgrin, her sallow face becoming a fiery red; &quot;am I not
telling you again and again that Mrs. Jarsell never went to see your rubbishy
race. She came here to get some eggs from me, and sat in this very room at nine
o'clock, or a little after. You take me for a liar, you--you--oh, I'll best see
to the dinner, or I'll lose my temper,&quot; and the sharp-tongued woman, having
already lost it, bounced out of the room. &quot;Mrs. Jarsell was here at nine
o'clock, or a little after,&quot; repeated Dan, in a wondering tone, &quot;then she could
not have been in London. All the same, I swear I saw her on that cinematograph.&quot;
Here he opened his bag and took out an &quot;A.B.C.,&quot; to see the trains from Thawley
to London. An examination showed him that, even if Mrs. Jarsell had left Thawley
Station at nine o'clock exactly, she would not have reached St. Pancras until
twelve-five. This would scarcely give her time to arrive at Blackheath. The
aeroplanes had started in the race at one o'clock, and, according to the
evidence at the inquest, the people had been looking at them flying northward at
the moment Durwin was stabbed. Mrs. Jarsell could not have arrived on the ground
by one o'clock if she only got to St. Pancras at mid-day. And then, to do that,
she would have been obliged to leave Thawley at nine o'clock. According to
George she had not been near the station on that day, and if Mrs. Pelgrin was to
be believed, she was in the very room he now occupied at the hour when the
express departed. It was clearly impossible that she could have got to Thawley
for the nine o'clock train, let alone it being impossible that had she caught
the express she could have arrived in London to execute the crime by one
o'clock, or a trifle later. Yet, on the other hand, was the evidence of Mrs.
Pelgrin and her nephew, while on the other hand was the evidence of the
cinematograph. One or the other must assuredly be wrong. Of course the landlady
and George might be telling lies, but on the face of it there was no need for
them to do so. Moreover, as Dan had sprung his questions on them unexpectedly,
they could not have been ready with false answers. &quot;She must have used a
motor-car,&quot; thought Halliday, restoring the &quot;A.B.C.&quot; to his bag, &quot;yet even so,
she was here at nine o'clock, and could not have reached town in the three hours
and odd minutes. D---- it!&quot; Mrs. Pelgrin brought in the dinner with compressed
lips and showed small disposition to chatter. Anxious not to arouse her
suspicions by asking any further questions, Dan began to talk of other matters,
and gradually she became more friendly. He told her that he had employed George
and had given him half-a-crown, since the mention of money appeared to melt her
into civility more than did anything else. Mrs. Pelgrin smiled grimly and
observed that &quot;George was a grasping hound,&quot; an amiable speech which did not
argue that she was on the best of terms with the sleepy-eyed man at Thawley
Station. After Dan had learned indirectly all he could from her he sought out
Vincent's cottage, only to learn that the inventor and his niece were absent for
the day. As he could frame no excuse to visit Mrs. Jarsell there was nothing
left for him to do but to travel back to town; therefore he found himself once
more in St. Pancras Station, comparatively early in the evening, wondering what
was the solution of this new problem.</p>

<h4>CHAPTER XII</h4>
<h5><a name="div1_12" href="#div1Ref_12">AN AMAZING ADVENTURE</a></h5>
<br>

<p>Next day
Dan went to look up Laurance and have a consultation, as he was considerably
puzzled over the new problem and did not know exactly how to act. But Fate was
against him, so far as having a second opinion was concerned, for Laurance
proved to be absent. An anarchistic plot, of which <i>The Moment</i> desired to know
the details, had taken him to Vienna, and it was probable that he would not
return for at least a week. Halliday might have expected something of the sort,
as in the prosecution of his business Freddy was here, there, and everywhere,
never knowing his next destination, which depended entirely on the latest
sensation. But hitherto few startling events had summoned Laurance out of
England, and Dan had been accustomed to always finding him on the spot for a
consultation. He left the office of <i>The Moment</i> in a rather disconsolate frame
of mind. There was no doubt that Halliday badly needed someone to talk to about
the matters which occupied his thoughts. But, failing Freddy, who was working
with him, he did not know any one worth consulting--anyone, that is, whose
advice would be worth taking. Certainly there were the two inspectors of
police--one at Hampstead, and one at Blackheath--who were deeply interested in
the respective deaths of Moon and Durwin. They would have been delighted to
discuss the entire business threadbare in the hope of solving the mystery of the
two crimes. But Dan did not wish to bring the police into the matter until he
had more evidence to go upon. After all, what he knew concerning Mrs. Jarsell
and Penn was both vague and uncertain, while the clue of the perfume being so
slight might be scouted as ridiculous by these cut-and-dried officials. What
Halliday wished to do was to establish a connection between the doings at
Sheepeak, Blackheath, and Hampstead on evidence that could not be questioned, so
that he might submit a complete case to the police. He could not do this until
he acquired positive proof, and he desired to acquire the same by his own
endeavors supplemented by those of Laurance. Therefore, as Freddy was away on
business, and Dan did not care about placing his unfinished case before the
inspectors, he went about his ordinary affairs, waiting for his friend's return.
This was all that he could do, and he did it reluctantly. A hint from Lord
Curberry had evidently made Sir John more vigilant as regarded his niece. Dan
called at the house and was denied an interview; he wrote a letter and received
no answer; and although he haunted Bond Street and Regent Street, the parks and
the theatres, he could catch no glimpse of Lillian. After three days of
unavailing endeavor he went to Bedford and attended to the transfer of his
aeroplane to Blackheath, bringing it up in the train personally. Then he put it
together again, and took short flights in the vicinity of London, after
repairing the damage done to the propeller. All the same, his heart was not in
the business of aviation at the moment as the detective fever had seized him and
he felt that he could not rest until he had solved the mystery of the two
crimes. But at the moment, he saw no way by which he could advance toward a
consummation of his wishes, and simply fiddled away his time until the return of
Laurance. Then, after a threshing out of details, he hoped to make some sort of
move in the darkness. But Fate decreed that he should act alone and without
advice, and the intimation of Fate's intention came in the form of a short
letter from Marcus Penn, asking for an interview. &quot;I am confident,&quot; wrote the
secretary, &quot;that from what you threatened in the aeroplane you suspect me of
knowing something relative to Sir Charles Moon's murder. As I am entirely
innocent I resent these suspicions, and I wish you to meet me in order that they
should be cleared away. If you will meet me at the booking-office of the
Bakerloo Tube, I can take you to the person who gave me the perfume. He will be
able to tell you that I have no connection with any criminal.&quot; Then the letter
went on to state day and hour of the appointment, and ended with the feeble
signature of the writer. Dan always thought that Penn's signature revealed only
too plainly the weakness of his character. Of course he intended to go, even
though he remembered that Penn had declared the identity of the person who had
given him the perfume. His cousin in Sumatra had sent the same to him, the
secretary had said, yet he now proposed to introduce Dan to another person, who
was the donor of the scent. Unless, indeed--and this was possible--the Sumatra
cousin had come to England with the intention of exonerating Penn. Certainly,
Penn might mean mischief, and might be dexterously luring him to a trap. But
Halliday felt that he was quite equal to dealing with a timid personality such
as the secretary possessed. Also, when going to keep the appointment, he slipped
a revolver into his hip-pocket, to be used if necessary. It might be--and Dan's
adventurous blood reached fever heat at the mere idea--that Penn intended to
introduce him to his brother scoundrels, who constituted this mysterious gang.
If so, there was a very good chance that at last he might learn something
tangible concerning the organization. Undoubtedly there was a great risk of his
losing liberty if not life, and it was impossible to say what precautions this
society of cut-throats might take to preserve its secrets. But Halliday was not
of a nervous nature, and, moreover, was willing to risk everything on one cast
of the die, instead of lingering in suspense. He therefore got himself ready
without saying a word to any one, and kept the appointment. And, indeed, now
that Laurance was absent, there was no one to whom he could speak. It chanced to
be a somewhat foggy night when Dan descended to the underground in Trafalgar
Square, but out of the darkness and in the light he had no difficulty in
recognizing Penn. The secretary was well wrapped up in a heavy great-coat, and
welcomed the young man with a nervous smile, blinking his pale eyes furiously,
as was his custom when much moved. However, he spoke amiably enough, and
appeared to bear no malice against his companion, notwithstanding the threat in
the aeroplane. &quot;I am glad you have come, Mr. Halliday,&quot; said Penn in a would-be
dignified tone, &quot;as I wish to clear my character from the grave doubts you cast
upon it when we last met.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Your admissions favored the grave doubts,&quot; retorted
Dan lightly. &quot;I spoke foolishly, Mr. Halliday, as I was quite upset by your
threats.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;H'm! I wonder to see you trust yourself again to such a bloodthirsty
being as I am, Mr. Penn.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Oh, I knew you were only bluffing in the aeroplane,&quot;
said the secretary in a meek voice and with a shrug. &quot;The means you took to
escape further questioning showed me that!&quot; The dry tone of Dan stirred the
man's chilly blood to greater heat. &quot;You have no right to interfere with my
private affairs,&quot; he said furiously. &quot;But when those affairs have to do with a
crime----&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;They have not. I know nothing about the matter,&quot; Penn's breath was
short, and he tried to keep his voice from quavering. &quot;When you see my cousin he
will prove that he gave me the scent.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Oh! then your Sumatra cousin is now in
England?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yes! Otherwise, I should not have asked you to come.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Are we to meet
him here?&quot; questioned Dan, glancing round curiously. &quot;No. We can go to him in a
taxi. I thought of the tube first, but we can get to our destination quicker in
a motor. Come!&quot; and Penn, leading the way, ascended the stairs, down which
Halliday had lately come. &quot;Where are we going to?&quot; asked Dan, but the secretary,
being some distance ahead, either did not hear the question, or did not desire
to reply to the same. &quot;I suppose,&quot; added Halliday, as the two stood once more in
the foggy upper-world, &quot;that your cousin wishes to see Mrs. Jarsell?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;My cousin
doesn't know Mrs. Jarsell, neither do I,&quot; retorted Penn sharply. &quot;Curious that
she should possess the perfume,&quot; murmured Dan sceptically, &quot;and one which you
say is unique.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;In England that is,&quot; said the secretary, as they stepped into a
taxi-cab which evidently was waiting for them, near the Trafalgar Square lions,
&quot;but, this lady whose name you mention may know someone in Sumatra also, and in
that way the perfume may have come into her possession.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Ah!&quot; Dan made himself
comfortable, while Penn pulled up the windows of the taxi, so as to keep out the
damp air, &quot;the long arm of coincidence?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;The improbable usually occurs in real
life and not in novels, Mr. Halliday.&quot; Dan laughed and watched the street lights
flash past the blurred windows as the taxi turned up the Haymarket. He wondered
where they were going, and as he believed that Penn would not give him any
information he carefully watched to see the route. His companion adjusted his
silk muffler well over his mouth, with a murmured explanation about his weak
lungs, and then held out a silver cigarette case to Dan, clicking it open as he
did so. &quot;Will you smoke, Mr. Halliday?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;No, thank you,&quot; replied the other
cautiously, &quot;for the present I don't care about it,&quot; and Penn shrugged his
shoulders, evidently understanding that Dan did not trust him or his gifts.
After a time he took out a cigarette and lighted a match. &quot;These cigarettes are
of a particular kind,&quot; he remarked, and blew a cloud of smoke directly under
Halliday's nose, after which he readjusted the muffler, not only over his mouth,
but over his nose. Dan started, for the whiff of smoke filled the close
confinement of the taxi with the well-known flavor of the Sumatra scent. He was
about to make a remark when the scent grew stronger as the cigarette burned
steadily with a red, smoldering tip, and he felt suddenly faint. &quot;Pull down the
window,&quot; he gasped, and leaned forward to do so himself. For answer, Penn
suddenly pulled the young man back into his seat, and enveloped him in a cloud
of drowsy smoke, keeping his own mouth and nose well covered meanwhile with the
silk muffler. Halliday made a faint struggle to retain his senses and the
control of his muscles, but the known world receded rapidly from him and he
seemed to be withdrawn into gulfs of utter gloom. The last coherent thought
which came into his mind was that the pretended cigarette produced by Penn was a
drugged pastil. Then an effort to grasp the undoubted fact that he had been
lured into a skilful trap which had shut down on him, used up his remaining
will-power, and he remembered no more. Whither he went into darkness, or what he
did, Dan never knew, as there seemed to be no break in the time that elapsed
from his becoming unconscious in the taxi and waking with the acrid smell of
some reviving salts in his nostrils. He might have been on earth or in sky or
sea; he did not know, for he opened his eyes languidly in a dense gloom. &quot;Where
am I?&quot; he asked, but there was no reply. His senses came back to him with a
rush, owing perhaps to the power of the stimulant applied to bring him round. He
sat up alertly in his chair, and felt immediately that his arms were bound
tightly to his sides, so that he could not use his revolver, or even strike a
match. He certainly would have done this latter, had he been able to, for he
greatly desired to be informed as to the quality of his surroundings. He
presumed that he was in a large room of some kind, and he became convinced by
his sixth sense that the room was crowded with people. When fully himself Dan
could hear the soft breathing of many unseen beings, but whether they were men
or women, or a mixture of the sexes, he could not say. Even when his eyes became
accustomed to the gloom he could discern nothing, for the darkness was that of
Egypt. And the silence, save for the steady breathing, was most uncanny. Dan
felt it incumbent on him to make some attempt towards acquiring knowledge. &quot;What
is the meaning of this outrage?&quot; he demanded loudly and in a resolute tone. &quot;I
insist upon knowing!&quot; From the near distance came a whispering voice, which made
him shiver. &quot;No one insists here,&quot; said the unknown speaker, &quot;all obey.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Who is
it that all obey?&quot; demanded the prisoner undauntedly. &quot;Queen Beelzebub!&quot;
murmured the voice, soft and sibilant. There flashed into Dan's mind some
teaching, secular or sacred--he could not tell which at the moment--relative to
a deity who had to do with flies. A Ph&#339;nician deity he fancied, but surely if
his memory served him, a male godling. Beelzebub, the god of Flies! He
remembered now, and remembered also the trade-mark of the mysterious society
formed for the purpose of murdering various people for various reasons, known
and unknown. &quot;So you have got me at last,&quot; he said aloud. &quot;I might have guessed
that Penn would trap me.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;No names,&quot; said the unseen speaker coldly; &quot;it will
be the worse for you if you mention names.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Am I addressing Beelzebub?&quot; asked
Dan, and for the life of him he could not keep the irony out of his tones, for
the whole thing was so theatrical. &quot;Queen Beelzebub!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I see; you have given the
god of Flies a consort. May I ask why I have been brought here?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;We intend to
make you an offer.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Who we? What we?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;The members of the Society of Flies, of
which I am the head.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;H'm, I understand. Don't you think you had better loose
my hands and turn up the lights?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Be silent,&quot; ordered the voice imperiously,
and, as Dan fancied, with some hint of temper at the flippant way in which he
talked; &quot;be silent and listen!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I can't help myself,&quot; said Halliday coolly, &quot;go
on, please.&quot; There was a soft rustle, as if the unseen company admired his
courage for behaving calmly in what was, undoubtedly, a weird and trying
situation. Then some distance away a disk of red light, like a winter sun,
appeared with nerve-shaking swiftness. It revealed none of the company, for all
were still in the gloom, but concentrated its angry rays on a large and solemn
visage, unhuman in its stillness and awful calm. It was an Egyptian face, such
as belongs to the statues of the gods of Kem, and the head-dress, stiff and
formal, was also suggestive of the Nile. Of more than usual size, Dan could only
see its vast features, but fancied that a red robe fell in folds from the neck
downward. There was something grand about this severe face, and in the darkness,
with the scarlet light gleaming fiercely on its immobility, it was assuredly
effective, if somewhat theatrical. The lips did not move when Queen Beelzebub
began to speak, but the eyes were alive; the eyes of the person concealed behind
the mask. Dan noticed that, when the face became visible in the angry red light,
the speaker ceased to whisper, and the voice became deep, voluminous, and
resonant as that of a gong. The tone was that of a man, but it might have been a
woman speaking through an artificial mouthpiece. The final thing which Dan
noticed was that the whole atmosphere of the room reeked with the rich fragrance
of the Sumatra scent. &quot;You are very daring and meddlesome,&quot; said the voice,
issuing in chilly tones from behind the stately mask, &quot;for you have intruded
yourself into affairs which have nothing to do with you.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;They have everything
to do with me,&quot; retorted Halliday decisively and feeling reckless, &quot;if you and
your society are omniscient, you should know.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Omniscient is a good word. We
know that you love Lillian Moon and wish to marry her; we know that her uncle is
willing this should be, if you discover the truth about his brother's death. You
have been searching for the assassin, and you are still searching. That search
must stop.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I think not.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;If you refuse to obey,&quot; said Queen Beelzebub coldly,
&quot;we can put you out of the way as we have put others out of the way.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;The
Law----&quot; A faint murmur of laughter was heard, suggestive of scorn. &quot;We care
nothing for the law,&quot; said the speaker contemptuously. &quot;Oh, I think you do, or
you would not have taken all this trouble to have me brought here.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;You are
here to receive an offer.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Indeed. I shall be glad to hear the offer.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;We wish
you to join the Society of Flies and swear to obey me, the queen.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Thank you,
but an association of cut-throats does not appeal to me.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Think twice before
you refuse,&quot; the voice became threatening. &quot;I think once, and that is
sufficient,&quot; returned Dan drily. &quot;You are at our mercy. We can kill you as we
have killed others.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;There are worse things than death. Dishonor.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;You talk
like a fool,&quot; scoffed Queen Beelzebub. &quot;What is dishonor? Merely a word. It
means nothing.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I can well believe that it means nothing to you and your
friends,&quot; said Dan, who was weary of this fencing: &quot;may I ask what advantage I
gain by becoming a member of your bloodthirsty gang?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;We are an association,&quot;
boomed the great voice, &quot;banded against the injustice of the world. We resent
few people having wealth and the majority going without the necessaries of life.
Being limited in number, the Law is too strong for us, and we cannot gain our
objects openly; therefore we have to strike in the dark.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;And your objects?&quot;
&quot;To equalize wealth, to give our members wealth, position, comfort, and power.&quot;
&quot;Oh. It's a kind of Socialistic community. You work for the poor.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;We work for
ourselves. &quot;Rather selfish, isn't it?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;People will only work for self, and to
those who labor for us we give all that they wish for. Become a member and you
will realize your heart's desire.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Perhaps,&quot; said Halliday in a caustic tone,
&quot;I may realize that without your aid.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;We think not. To marry Lillian Moon you
must find who murdered her father, and that person will never be found.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Then
why stop me from searching?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;It is a pity you should waste your time,&quot; said
Queen Beelzebub sarcastically, &quot;besides you are one who would do honor to our
society.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Perhaps. But would the society do honor to me?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;We can give you what
you desire, on certain conditions.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;What are they?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;You must take the oath and
sign the book; swear to obey me, who am the head of this association, without
question; promise to be secret, and give all your talents to forwarding the aims
of the Society of Flies.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;H'm,&quot; said Dan coolly, &quot;a very comprehensive oath
indeed. And the aims?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Wealth and power. We are banded together to get what we
want, independent of the law, and we think that the end justifies the means. We
accept money from those people who desire to get rid of their enemies, or of
those who stand between them and their desires. We supply plans of English forts
to foreign powers on condition that large sums are paid to us. We trade on the
secrets of people, which we learn in various ways. If we are asked by any member
to get him something, all the resources of the society are at his disposal.
Rivals can be removed if he wants to marry; relatives can be put out of the way,
if he wishes for their money. There is no height to which an ambitious man
cannot climb with our aid. Join us and you shall marry Lillian Moon within the
year and also shall enjoy her large fortune.&quot; Desirous to learn more of the
villainies with which this precious band of scoundrels were concerned, Dan
temporized. &quot;And if I refuse?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;You will be put to death!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Now? At this very
moment?&quot; Dan's blood ran cold, for, after all, he was yet young, and life was
sweet to him. &quot;No. You will be allowed to go, and death shall fall upon you when
you least expect it. Thus your agony will be great, for death may find you
to-morrow, or in a week, a month, or a year. We are not afraid you will tell the
police, for if you do it will only hasten your end. Besides, you do not know
where you are, and shall be taken away as secretly as you have been brought
here. The Law cannot touch us, because we work under ground like moles, and even
if you told the police, your story of what has happened would only be laughed
at. The police,&quot; here the voice sneered, &quot;think everything is known and refuse
to believe that we exist.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Well,&quot; said Dan, as if making up his mind, &quot;can I
ever leave the society if I once join it?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yes,&quot; said Queen Beelzebub
unexpectedly, &quot;when you take the oath you must swear to be sober, chaste, and
secret, since these qualities are needed to keep a member in good working trim.
A certain amount of work you must do in connection with our aims, so that you
dare not speak without being implicated in our doings. But, after a time, you
can leave with money, position, or power--whatever you desire, and then can lead
your own life, however profligate it may be. But while a member you must be a
saint.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;A black saint,&quot; murmured Dan, wondering at the solid ground upon which
this association was founded, and thinking how dangerous it could be with its
misdirected aims, &quot;well, I don't say 'No' and I don't say 'Yes.' I must have
time to think what my answer will be.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;You shall have one month to consider,
and then you shall be brought here secretly again,&quot; said Queen Beelzebub
authoritatively, &quot;but you will be wise if you join us. We wish you to do so
because you have brains, and we want brains. Our society will rule the world if
we get clever men to join, as the training of our members in sobriety, chastity,
self-control, and secrecy is that of the so-called saints.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I see,&quot; said Dan
cheerfully, &quot;the Lord's Prayer said backward, so to speak, your Majesty. Well,
the whole business is clever, and extremely well managed as I can see. I shall
take my month's respite, and then----&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;And then if you say 'Yes,' you will have
all that the world can give you; if you say 'No,' prepare for death.&quot; A murmur,
vague and indistinct, went round the dark room. &quot;Prepare for death.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;And if I
speak to the police in the meantime?&quot; asked Dan yawning. &quot;You have been warned
that if you do, death will follow immediately,&quot; declared Queen Beelzebub, &quot;no
human law can protect you from us. Enough has been said, and you have thirty
days to decide what to do.&quot; As she spoke, the red light vanished as abruptly as
it had come. Dan could only hear the steady breathing of many people in the
gloom, and wondered how many members of this devilish society were present. At
that moment, and while the thought was yet in his mind, he felt that a pastil
was being held under his nose. The drowsy scent stole into his brain, although
he tried to avert his head, and almost immediately he became again unconscious.
Again he fell into gulfs of gloom, and remembered nothing. When he recovered his
senses, he was seated in a four wheeler, driving in an unknown direction, and he
was alone. His head ached, but he struck a match and looked at his watch. It was
eleven o'clock. &quot;Where did you find me?&quot; he asked the cabman, putting his head
out of the window, and noticing that he was in a well-lighted street. &quot;A friend
of yours brought you to my cab,&quot; said the man, &quot;saying you was drunk--dead
drunk. He gave me your address, and I'm taking you home.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Clever,&quot; said Dan to
himself, accepting the explanation without comment.</p>

<h4>CHAPTER XIII</h4>
<h5><a name="div1_13" href="#div1Ref_13">A BOLD DETERMINATION</a></h5>
<br>

<p>Dan went to bed with an aching head, doubtless induced by the
power of the drug which had been used to stupefy him. The Sumatra perfume was
evidently both powerful and useful, as it was used by the Society of Flies not
only as a means of recognition in the form of a harmless scent, but as a
soporific to bring about insensibility. Probably many a person had been rendered
unconscious by the drowsy smoke, and taken to the headquarters of the infernal
association, there to become members. But where the headquarters were to be
found, Dan had not the slightest notion. And, as his head pained him greatly, he
decided to wait until the next morning before thinking out the matter. Off and
on he managed to sleep a trifle, but it was not until the small hours that true
slumber came to him. It was nine o'clock when he woke, and then he found his
head clear, and the pain absent. Only an evil taste remained in his mouth, and
after a cold bath he felt more himself, although a touch of languor remained to
recall to his recollection what he had been through. After breakfast he lighted
a pipe, and began to think over late events as carefully as was necessary. On
alighting at his own door he had paid the driver of the four-wheeled cab, and
had asked questions, which the man was willing enough to answer. Halliday hoped
by learning where the cabman had picked him up, to discover at least the
neighborhood wherein the headquarters were situated. It was difficult to think
that an unconscious person, as he had been, could have been taken any great
distance along streets, or roads, or lanes, without attention being attracted.
But the cabman explained that the friend who had placed his fare in the
four-wheeler, had removed him from a taxi, which the friend declared had broken
down. &quot;And he wanted to get you home, you being drunk,&quot; explained the driver,
&quot;so he shoved you into my trap, and I drove off, having the address I was to
take you to, leaving your friend to look after the broken-down taxi, along with
the chauffer.&quot; From this explanation it was apparent that on being removed from
the dark room Dan had been transported for some distance, long or short, in the
taxi. He did not believe that the same had broken down, but that his
friend--probably Marcus Penn--had hailed the first cab he saw, and on pretence
of an accident had got rid of him in this clever way. It was West Kensington
where this exchange had taken place, according to the cabman's story, but since
he had been driven an indefinite distance by Penn in the taxi, the headquarters
might be in Hampstead, or Blackheath, or Ilford, or, indeed, anywhere round
about London, if not in the heart of the metropolis itself. All bearings were
lost by the clever way in which the return had been carried out. And now
Halliday scarcely knew what to do, or how to act. He did not dare to tell the
police, as the first sign of activity on the part of the authorities would mean
his own death in some mysterious way. He also would be found with an artificial
fly near the wound and the odor of the Sumatra scent on his clothes. As Dan did
not wish to die, he therefore hesitated to make any statement to Inspector
Tenson of Hampstead, who was so anxious to learn the secret and gain the reward.
In fact, he hoped that the man would not come to his rooms--he had been there
several times in quest of information--lest he should smell the Sumatra scent.
Dan found that he had brought the perfume away on his clothes when he examined
them, which was scarcely to be wondered at considering how powerfully the dark
room had reeked of the odor. Certainly Tenson did not know the scent so well as
Halliday did, although he had experienced a whiff of it when examining the body
of Sir Charles Moon. But he might have forgotten the smell. While Dan turned
over his clothes--the blue serge suit he had worn on the previous night--he
found a piece of paper in one of the trousers pockets, which contained a message
typewritten in crimson ink. It was set forth in the third person, by no less an
individual than Queen Beelzebub herself, and ran as follows--</p>
<br>

<p>&quot;QUEEN BEELZEBUB warns Daniel Halliday that not only his own life depends upon his secrecy but
the life of Lillian Moon also. Should he apply to the authorities, or in any way
recount his adventures, the girl he loves will be put out of the way, and
afterwards Daniel Halliday will be dealt with. At the end of thirty days Queen
Beelzebub expects to receive homage from her new subject, who will receive
notice of time and place fixed for the ceremony. Remember!&quot;</p>
<br>

<p>&quot;Quite a
Charles-the-First ring about that last word,&quot; thought Dan, frowning at the
threatening message; &quot;the scoundrels: they have tied my hands with a vengeance.
What the deuce am I to do?&quot; It was useless for him to ask himself this question
as the only answer could be, &quot;Nothing!&quot; If he moved in any way likely to harm
the society he ran the chance of sacrificing, not only himself, but Lillian. It
was bad enough that he should be done to death; but he might have risked that so
as to break up the organization; but it was impossible to place the girl he
loved in so dangerous a position. Queen Beelzebub knew what she was about when
she used the phrase. And Halliday was well aware that the Society had a long
arm, and that nothing could protect Lillian from these moles who were working in
darkness--clever, deadly, and unscrupulous. For the next two days the young man
went about in a dream, or rather in a nightmare. He did not dare to see Lillian,
or to write to Lillian, lest the members of the Society should believe he was
betraying them. They appeared to have spies everywhere, and there was no move on
the chessboard which he could make which might not be detected. Yet he could not
wait passively for the rest of the thirty days, since he had no idea of joining
the band and had only asked for a respite so as to think out some means of
escape. More than ever he longed for the return of Laurance. He could trust him,
and a consultation between the two might evolve some scheme by which to baffle
the subjects of the accursed woman who called herself Queen Beelzebub. Dan
wondered if she was Mrs. Jarsell, but the evidence of the perfume seemed too
slight a link to join her with this deadly organization. Of course there was
Marcus Penn who was a member and knew everything; but he would not speak, since
he ran also a risk of death should he betray too much. Still, Dan, being in the
same boat and under the same ban, fancied that the secretary might be frank, as
his confidence could not be abused. Now, if he could get Penn to state
positively that Mrs. Jarsell was Queen Beelzebub, he might have something
tangible upon which to work. But, taking into consideration the Egyptian mask,
and the alteration of the voice by means of the artificial mouthpiece, Dan
believed that she wished to keep her identity secret; always presuming that
Queen Beelzebub was the &quot;she&quot; in question. On this assumption Halliday concluded
that Penn would not speak out, and bothered himself for hours as to whether it
would be worth while to ask the secretary questions. While still in this
undecided frame of mind he received a morning visit from Laurance, who turned up
unexpectedly. Freddy, in pursuit of his business, played puss-in-the-corner all
over the world, coming and going from London in the most unexpected manner. He
reminded Dan of this when the young man jumped up with an exclamation at his
sudden entrance. &quot;You might have known that I would turn up, anyhow,&quot; he said,
sitting down, and accepting an offer to have breakfast. &quot;I never know where I
shall be on any given date, and you must be always prepared for the unexpected
so far as I am concerned. I heard you were looking for me, when I returned last
night from Vienna, so I came along to feed with you.&quot; Halliday ordered his man
to bring in a clean cup, and poured out coffee, after which he heaped Freddy's
plate with bacon and kidneys. &quot;There you are, old fellow, eat away and get
yourself ready for a long talk. I have heaps to tell you likely to be
interesting.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;About the murder of Durwin?&quot; questioned Laurance, reaching for
toast. &quot;Yes, and about the murder of Sir Charles Moon also. You don't mind my
smoking while you eat?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;No. Smoke away! Have you seen <i>The Moment</i> this
morning?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;No. Anything interesting in it about your Austrian excursion?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Oh,
yes,&quot; said Laurance indifferently, &quot;I managed to learn a good deal about these
anarchistic beasts and it's set all out in print. But that's not what I meant,&quot;
he fumbled in his pockets. &quot;Hang it, I haven't brought a paper, and I meant to.
There's a death chronicled this morning.&quot; Dan sat up and shivered. &quot;Another of
the murders?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yes. Marcus Penn this time.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Penn!&quot; Halliday dropped his pipe,
&quot;the devil,&quot; he picked it up again, &quot;I wonder why they killed him?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;He told you
too much, maybe,&quot; said Laurance drily; &quot;anyhow, the gang has got rid of him by
drowning him in an ornamental pond in Curberry's grounds.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;He might have fallen
in,&quot; suggested Dan uneasily, &quot;or he might have committed suicide out of sheer
terror.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Well, he might have,&quot; admitted Freddy, thoughtfully, &quot;but from what I
saw of the man I should think he was too great a coward to commit suicide.&quot; Dan
smoked in a meditative manner. &quot;I suppose she killed him, or had him killed,&quot; he
said aloud, after a pause. &quot;She? Who?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;The she-devil who presides over the
Society of Flies. Queen Beelzebub.&quot; Laurance dropped his knife and fork to stare
hard at his friend. &quot;So you have learned something since I have been away?&quot;
&quot;Several things. Wait a moment.&quot; Dan rose and retired to his bedroom, while
Freddy pushed away the breakfast things as he did not wish to eat further in the
face of Halliday's hint which had taken away his appetite. In a few minutes Dan
came back to the sitting-room carrying the clothes he had worn on the night of
his kidnapping, which still retained a faint odor of the fatal scent belonging
to the gang. &quot;Smell that,&quot; said Dan, placing the clothes on his friend's knee.
Laurance sniffed. &quot;Is this the Sumatra scent?&quot; he asked; &quot;h'm, quite a tropical
fragrance. But I thought you proved to your satisfaction that there was nothing
in this perfume business?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I always had my doubts,&quot; said Halliday drily, &quot;they
were lulled by Penn's lies and reawakened when I found the scent at Mrs.
Jarsell's. Now I know all about the matter. I place my life in your hands by
telling you.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Is it as serious as that?&quot; asked Laurance uneasily. &quot;Yes. Serious
to me and to Lillian also. Read that.&quot; The journalist scanned the crimson
typewriting, and his eyes opened larger and larger as he grasped the meaning of
the message. &quot;Where the deuce did you get this?&quot; he demanded hurriedly. &quot;I found
it in my pocket when I got back the other night.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Where from?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;From the
headquarters of the Society of Flies.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;There is a gang then?&quot; asked Laurance,
starting. &quot;Yes. A very well-organized gang, presided over by Queen Beelzebub,
the consort of the gentleman of that name, who is the god of Flies.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Where are
the headquarters?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I don't know.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;We may be able to trace the gang by this,&quot;
said Freddy, examining the typewritten paper. &quot;If Inspector Tenson----&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;If
Tenson gets hold of that and learns anything, which by the way I don't think he
can, from that paper, my life won't be worth a cent; neither will that of
Lillian's. I might not care for my own life, but I care a great deal for hers. I
want to have a consultation as to what is best to be done to save her from these
devils.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Well, you can depend upon my saying nothing, Dan. It seems serious.
Tell me all about your discoveries.&quot; Halliday did so, starting with his visit to
the cinematograph with Lillian, and his recognition of Mrs. Jarsell in the
animated picture. Then he recounted his journey to Hillshire, and what he had
learned from Mrs. Pelgrin and her nephew. &quot;So on the face of it,&quot; concluded Dan
earnestly, &quot;I don't see how Mrs. Jarsell could have got to London. She didn't go
by train and could not have gone by motor. Yet, I'm sure she was on the
Blackheath grounds.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;It is a puzzle,&quot; admitted Freddy, drawing his brows
together, &quot;but go on; you have something else to tell me.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Rather,&quot; and Dan
detailed all that had taken place from the time he received Penn's invitation to
meet him in the Bakerloo Tube to the moment he arrived at his rooms again in the
four-wheeler. &quot;What do you make of it all, Freddy?&quot; asked Halliday, when he
ended and relighted his pipe. &quot;Give me time to think,&quot; said Laurance, and rose
to pace the room. For a time there was a dead silence, each man thinking his own
thoughts. It was Dan who spoke first, and said what was uppermost in his mind.
&quot;Of course my hands are tied,&quot; he said dismally, &quot;I dare not risk Lillian's
life. The beasts have killed her father, and Durwin and Penn, all because they
got to know too much. They may kill Lillian also and in the same mysterious
way.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;But she knows nothing,&quot; said Freddy anxiously. &quot;No. But I do, and if I
speak--well, then you know what will happen. Queen Beelzebub saw that I cared
little for my own life, so she is striking at me through Lillian. 'The girl he
loves!' says that message. Clever woman Mrs. Jarsell; she has me on toast.&quot;
&quot;But, my dear fellow, you can't be sure that your masked demon is Mrs. Jarsell,
since you did not see her face, or recognize her voice.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I admit that the mask
concealed her features, and I believe that she spoke through an artificial
mouthpiece to disguise the voice. Still, there is the evidence of her possessing
the perfume, which plays such a large part in the gang's doings. Also her
appearance in the animated picture, which proves her to have been on the
Blackheath ground.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;But Mrs. Pelgrin and her nephew declare positively that she
could not have been there.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Quite so, but Mrs. Pelgrin and her nephew may be
paid to keep silence,&quot; retorted Dan in a worried tone; &quot;then Miss Armour, if you
remember, prophesied that I should have a wonderful offer made to me. If I
accepted I should marry Lillian and enjoy a large fortune. Well, an offer in
precisely the same words was made to me, on condition that I joined the gang.&quot;
&quot;But surely you don't believe that a paralyzed woman like Miss Armour has
anything to do with this business?&quot; questioned Laurance skeptically. Dan
shrugged his shoulders. &quot;Miss Armour is the friend of Mrs. Jarsell, whom I
suspect, and certainly told my fortune as you heard. Mrs. Jarsell may have told
her what to say, knowing that the prophecy would be fulfilled. I don't say that
Miss Armour knows about this infernal organization, as the very idea would
horrify her. But Mrs. Jarsell may use the poor woman as a tool.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I can't
believe that Miss Armour knows anything,&quot; said Freddy decidedly; &quot;to begin with,
the Society of Flies needs useful people, and an invalid like Miss Armour would
be of no use.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I admit that Miss Armour is in the dark,&quot; replied Halliday
impatiently; &quot;all the same, her prophecy, together with the perfume and the
cinematograph evidence, hints at Mrs. Jarsell's complicity. Again, the false
Mrs. Brown who murdered Sir Charles was stout and massive. Mrs. Jarsell is stout
and massive.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Plenty of women are stout and massive,&quot; asserted the reporter,
&quot;but you saw the false Mrs. Brown yourself. Did you recognize Mrs. Jarsell as
that person?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;No. But Mrs. Brown was so wrinkled for a fat woman that I
remember thinking at the time she might be a fraud. I daresay--I am positive, in
fact--that her face was made up, and while I looked at her she let down her
veil--another hint that she did not wish to be examined too closely.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;If you
think that Mrs. Jarsell murdered Moon and Durwin, and you have the evidence you
speak of, you should reveal all to the police.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;And risk Lillian's life and my
own? Freddy, you must take me for a fool.&quot; Laurance shook his head. &quot;No. I don't
underrate your cleverness, and I see that you are in a tight place. You can't
move with safety to yourself and Miss Moon. Yet if you don't move, what is to be
done?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Well,&quot; said Dan, after a pause, &quot;I have a month to think matters out. My
idea is to hide Lillian somewhere under the care of Mrs. Bolstreath, and then
take action. So long as Lillian is safe I am ready to risk my own life to bring
these mysteries to light.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I am with you,&quot; cried Freddy enthusiastically, &quot;it's
a good scheme, Dan. I wonder how Miss Moon is to be hidden though; since the
Society of Flies may employ spies to find her whereabouts?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Oh, every member of
the society is a spy,&quot; was Halliday's answer, &quot;although I don't know how many
members of the gang there are. Penn could have told us, and perhaps could have
proved the identity of Mrs. Jarsell with Queen Beelzebub. But he's dead,
and----&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;And was murdered,&quot; broke in Laurance decisively. &quot;I am quite sure
that--because he could prove too much for Mrs. Jarsell's safety--he was got rid
of.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Oh!&quot; Dan looked up with a smile, &quot;then you believe that Mrs. Jarsell----&quot;
&quot;I don't know what to believe until more evidence is forthcoming,&quot; said the
reporter impatiently, &quot;but Miss Moon's hiding-place? Where is it best to place
her, with Mrs. Bolstreath as her guardian?&quot; Halliday reflected, and then made
the last answer Freddy expected to hear, considering the circumstances. &quot;At
Sheepeak with Miss Vincent,&quot; he declared. &quot;Dan, are you serious. You place her
under the guns of the enemy.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Quite so, and there has been proof that under the
guns is the safest place in some cases. It is in this, I am sure. Should Mrs.
Jarsell be the person we suspect her to be, she will not foul her own nest at
Sheepeak. Therefore she will not dare to have Lillian killed within a
stone-throw of her own house. By daring all, we gain all.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;It's a risk,&quot; said
Laurance pondering. &quot;I can see that.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;So can I. Everything is risky in this
business.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Then there's Mildred,&quot; rejoined the journalist uneasily. &quot;I really
do not want her to be brought into the matter.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;It will be all right, Freddy,
and much the safer for Lillian. Mrs. Jarsell won't have the courage to hurt my
promised wife, when your promised wife is in her company. Still, if you have
qualms----&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;No, no, no!&quot; interrupted Laurance eagerly, &quot;after all, I cannot be
half a friend, and if Mildred is willing--when she learns the whole circumstance
that is, I shall agree. After all, if anything does happen, we can accuse Mrs.
Jarsell, and if she is Queen Beelzebub she will end her career in jail. I don't
think she will risk that by hurting the girls.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Oh, she would never hurt Miss
Vincent, I am sure, and would only harm Lillian because I have to be frightened
into joining her gang. No, Freddy, a daring policy is the best in this case.
We'll place Lillian with Mrs. Bolstreath under Mildred Vincent's charge--under
the guns of the enemy as you say. I am sure the result will be good.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;But Sir
John Moon will make a row if you take his niece away.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Let him,&quot; retorted Dan
contemptuously. &quot;I can deal with that fribble of a man. After all, Lillian need
only be absent from London for a month, and during that time we must break up
the gang, with or without the aid of the police. If we don't, I shall certainly
be murdered, like Moon and Durwin and Penn have been, and on the same
grounds--that I know too much. But I daresay Lillian will then be left alone,
and Sir John can carry out his pet scheme and marry her to Curberry.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I
wonder,&quot; said Laurance musingly, &quot;if Curberry has anything to do with the gang
in question.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I think not, he has nothing to gain.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Now he hasn't,&quot; said
Freddy drily, &quot;but he had a good deal to gain when he was a barrister and two
lives stood between him and a title and a fortune.&quot; The two men looked at one
another. &quot;I see what you mean,&quot; said Dan slowly, &quot;h'm. Of course he may be a
member and the society may have cleared his uncle and cousin out of the way. But
we can't be sure. One thing at a time, Freddy. I am going to see Lillian and
Mrs. Bolstreath and get them to fly to Sheepeak.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;But you will have to reveal
what we know, and that will frighten them.&quot; Dan looked vexed and gnawed his
nether lip. &quot;I don't want to say more than is necessary,&quot; he replied, &quot;as for
their own safety, the less they know of the business, the better. Perhaps I may
induce Lillian to elope with me to Sheepeak, and need not explain to her. But
Mrs. Bolstreath must know more.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Well,&quot; said Freddy, putting on his hat, &quot;I
leave these matters in your very capable hands. So far as I am concerned, I am
going to Blackheath to see about this death of Penn. I may get into the house--&quot;
he paused. &quot;Well?&quot; asked Halliday, raising his eyebrows. &quot;Well, if Curberry does
favor this Society of Flies, who knows what I may discover? Also some truths may
come out at the inquest. Penn belonged to the gang as we know, and when he
wanted a situation, he was taken on by Lord Curberry. That hints at much.
However, we shall see; we shall see!&quot; and with a careless nod Freddy took his
leave, while Dan changed his clothes with the intention of calling at Sir John
Moon's house. Owing to a late breakfast, and the long conversation with
Laurance, it was quite one o'clock before Dan reached his destination. He half
expected to be refused admittance as usual, especially when he learned from the
footman that Miss Moon was not in the house. But failing Lillian, who had no
doubt gone out on a shopping expedition and would shortly return to luncheon,
Dan sent in his name to Mrs. Bolstreath, with a request for an interview. It was
best to explain the situation to her, he thought, since no time could be lost in
assuring Lillian's safety. The chaperon saw the young man at once, and when
introduced into the room where she was seated, he was struck by her worried air.
His thoughts immediately flew to the girl. &quot;Lillian?&quot; he asked anxiously, &quot;is
anything the matter with Lillian?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Oh, that girl will break my heart with her
freaks,&quot; said Mrs. Bolstreath in an irritable tone, &quot;she knows that Sir John
does not approve of her going out by herself, and that my retaining my situation
depends upon my looking after her closely. Yet she has gone out without telling
me.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Where has she gone to?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Well,&quot; said Mrs. Bolstreath, looking at him, &quot;I
think she has gone to Lord Curberry's house.&quot; Dan's lip curled. &quot;That ought to
please Sir John. Is he with her?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;No. Sir John is in the country for a few
days. He would not be pleased at Lillian going to see Lord Curberry without my
being present.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;But why has she gone to see a man she hates?&quot; asked Halliday
perplexed. &quot;It is not Lord Curberry she wishes to see,&quot; Mrs. Bolstreath
hesitated. &quot;I suppose you saw that Mr. Penn is dead?&quot; she asked irrelevantly.
&quot;It was in the morning paper, I know--that is, the announcement of his death,&quot;
said Dan. &quot;Laurance came and told me. Well?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;This morning Lillian received a
letter from Mr. Penn, written a few days ago, saying that if anything happened
to him, she was to go to Lord Curberry and find some important paper he has left
behind him for her perusal.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Oh,&quot; Dan started to his feet, &quot;then Penn has left
a confession?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;A confession?&quot; Mrs. Bolstreath looked puzzled. &quot;He must have
guessed that his death was determined upon,&quot; said Halliday to himself, but loud
enough for his companion to hear, &quot;perhaps the truth will come out in that
confession.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;What truth? For heaven's sake, Mr. Halliday, speak plainly. I am
worried enough as it is over Lillian's escapade. Is anything wrong?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;A great
deal. Mrs. Bolstreath, I have to confide in you in order to save Lillian from
death--from a death like her father suffered.&quot; Mrs. Bolstreath screamed. &quot;Oh,
what is it, what is it?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;You must be silent about what I tell you.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Of course
I shall. I can keep a secret. But tell me, tell me,&quot; she panted. &quot;If you don't
keep the secret all our lives are in jeopardy. There is no time to be lost. I
must follow Lillian to Curberry's house at once. Listen, Mrs. Bolstreath, and
remember every word I say is important.&quot; Then Dan hastily related much that he
knew, though not more than was absolutely necessary. However, he told enough to
make Mrs. Bolstreath almost crazy with terror. &quot;Keep your head and my
confidence,&quot; said Halliday sharply, &quot;we must beat these demons at their own
game. Get ready and come with me to Blackheath; on the way I can explain.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;You
think Lillian is safe?&quot; implored Mrs. Bolstreath, preparing to leave the room
and assume her out-of-door things. &quot;Yes. Yet, if Curberry is connected with the
gang and thinks she is hunting for Penn's confession, he may--but it won't bear
thinking of. We must go to Lillian at once. You will work with me to save
Lillian?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;With all my heart and soul and body,&quot; cried the chaperon wildly.
&quot;Then get ready and come with me at once,&quot; said Dan imperiously.</p>

<h4>CHAPTER XIV</h4>
<h5><a name="div1_14" href="#div1Ref_14">A BUSY AFTERNOON</a></h5>
<br>

<p>Lord Curberry was something of a student and a great deal of a
man-about-town, so his residence at Blackheath was an ideal one for an
individual who blended such opposite qualities. His pleasant Georgian mansion of
mellow red brick stood sufficiently far from London to secure privacy for study,
and yet was sufficiently near to enable its owner to reach Piccadilly, Bond
Street, the clubs and the theatres, easily when he felt so disposed. The chief
seat of the family, indeed, was situated in Somersetshire, but Curberry, not
possessing a sporting nature, rarely went to live in the country. The Blackheath
estate was not large, consisting only of a few acres of woodland, surrounded by
a lofty stone wall; but this wall and the trees of the park so sequestered the
house that its seclusion suggested a situation in the very wildest parts of
England. In every way, therefore, this compact place suited Lord Curberry and he
lived there for the greater part of the year. When Dan and Mrs. Bolstreath
arrived they found that the house had been thrown open to the public, so to
speak. That is, there was a crowd at the entrance-gates, many people in the
grounds, and not a few in the very mansion itself. There was not much difficulty
in guessing that Marcus Penn's death had drawn a morbid multitude into the
neighborhood wherein he had come to his untimely end. Moreover, the inquest was
to be held in the house, and the public desired ardently to hear if the verdict
would be &quot;Suicide!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Murder!&quot; or merely &quot;Accident!&quot; In any case, sensational
developments were expected, since the death of the secretary was both violent
and unexpected. As a barrister, Curberry assisted the law in every possible way
and had permitted the inquest to take place in the house instead of ordering the
body of the unfortunate man to be removed to the nearest mortuary. Every one
commented on his kindness in this respect, and approved of his consideration.
For the time being Curberry was more popular than he had ever been before. As
Dan walked up the short avenue and noted the disorganization of the
establishment, he made a significant remark to the agitated chaperon. &quot;I don't
think that Curberry will have much time to give to Lillian. All the better,
isn't it?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I'm sure I don't know what you mean,&quot; said Mrs. Bolstreath, much
flustered. &quot;Well, Penn must have concealed his confession somewhere about the
house, so if Lillian wishes to find it, she must get rid of Curberry somehow.&quot;
&quot;But wouldn't it be wise of her to tell him and ask him to assist in the
search?&quot; suggested the lady. &quot;No. If Penn wished Curberry to see his confession,
he would have given it to him for delivery to Lillian. He doesn't want Curberry
to see what he has written. H'm,&quot; Dan reflected that he had used the present
tense, &quot;I forgot that the poor chap is dead.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;But surely,&quot; Mrs. Bolstreath's
voice sank to a horrified whisper, &quot;surely you don't think that Lord Curberry
has anything to do with these horrible people you have been telling me about?&quot;
&quot;I say nothing--because I know nothing--for certain, that is. I only
suspect--er--well--that Curberry may be in the swim. Now don't go and give away
the show by changing your manner toward the man,&quot; continued Halliday hastily;
&quot;act as you have always acted and, indeed, I want you to make yourself as
agreeable as possible. Take him away if you can, and leave me alone with
Lillian.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;But for what reason?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Well, if Curberry is mixed up in this shady
business he will not leave Lillian alone. He may wonder, and probably does, at
her unexpected presence here, on this day of all days; therefore he may suspect
a confession by his secretary and will keep his eyes open.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Oh, you go too
far,&quot; cried Mrs. Bolstreath, fanning herself with her handkerchief. &quot;Perhaps I
do,&quot; assented Dan in a very dry tone, &quot;but in a case like this it is just as
well to take all necessary precautions. And in any case Curberry will haunt
Lillian's footsteps until she is out of the house, if only to find out why she
paid this unnecessary visit.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;He can ask her,&quot; said the chaperon curtly. &quot;He
won't, if he is what I suspect him to be. But there, I may be accusing the man
wrongfully.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I'm sure you are. Lord Curberry is a perfect gentleman.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Perfect
gentlemen have been discovered doing shady things before now. However, you know
what comedy we have arranged. You have come to fetch Lillian back, and I came to
escort you. Then get Curberry away on some pretext and let me have ten minutes
talk with Lillian. Understand?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yes,&quot; gasped Mrs. Bolstreath, &quot;but I don't like
these things.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;One can't touch pitch without being defiled,&quot; quoted Dan
cynically, as they arrived at the open hall door, &quot;we wish to see Lord
Curberry.&quot; This last question was addressed to a footman, who came to meet them.
He recognized Mrs. Bolstreath as having been in the house before with Miss Moon,
so readily explained that the young lady was with his master in the
drawing-room. Everything was so upset with the inquest, that he never thought of
asking for a card, so conducted the visitors to where Lord Curberry was
entertaining the girl. Having announced the names and fairly pushed them into
the room, the footman departed in a hurry, as there was much excitement amongst
the servants and he wished to hear all that was being said. Had not Curberry
been attending to Lillian, he would have kept better order, as he was a severe
master, and expected decency under all circumstances. But no doubt he also was
disturbed by the unusual invasion of his house. &quot;My--dear--Lillian,&quot; cried Mrs.
Bolstreath in large capitals, and advancing toward the end of the room, where
Lillian was seated, looking uncomfortable, &quot;my dear Lillian!&quot; She glared at Lord
Curberry. The gentleman had evidently been pressing his suit, a proceeding which
sufficiently explained Miss Moon's discomfort. He was as cadaverous as ever in
his looks, and his pale-blue eyes, thin lips and general sneering expression
struck Dan afresh as uncommonly unpleasant. The man flushed to a brick red under
Mrs. Bolstreath's glare and hastened to excuse himself. &quot;I am not to blame, I
assure you,&quot; he said hurriedly. &quot;Blame!&quot; echoed Lillian with a thankful glance
at the sight of her lover, &quot;why do you say 'blame,' Lord Curberry?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;You ask
that?&quot; said Mrs. Bolstreath, plumping down indignantly, &quot;when you go away
without my knowledge to pay an unauthorized visit to a-a-a bachelor. If I
thought that Lord Curberry----&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I am not to blame,&quot; said that gentleman again
with a scowl, for he did not like to stand on the defensive. &quot;Of course you
aren't,&quot; remarked Miss Moon easily, and with another glance at Dan to point her
words. &quot;I saw in the paper that poor Mr. Penn was dead, and as he had been my
dear father's secretary I came on the impulse of the moment to learn exactly
what had happened.&quot; Curberry nodded acquiescence. &quot;I have explained the
circumstance to Miss Moon and I shall explain matters to you, Mrs. Bolstreath!
As for Mr. Halliday,&quot; he frowned at Dan, &quot;I don't know why he has come.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;To
escort me, at my request,&quot; said Mrs. Bolstreath coldly. &quot;It was necessary for me
to call here and take Lillian home. Why did you come?&quot; she asked again. &quot;To hear
about Mr. Penn,&quot; repeated Lillian rather crossly. &quot;I have been telling you so
for the last few minutes.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I am curious about Penn's death myself,&quot; said Dan
agreeably, &quot;did he commit suicide?&quot; Curberry wheeled at the word. &quot;Why should he
commit suicide?&quot; he demanded with suspicion written on every line of his
clean-shaven face. Dan shrugged his shoulders. &quot;I'm sure I can't say,&quot; he
answered good-humoredly, &quot;only a man in good health isn't found drowned unless
he has some reason to get into the pond.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Penn was not in good health,&quot; said
Curberry sharply. &quot;He was always complaining and did his work so badly that I
intended to give him notice.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Perhaps he committed suicide because you did.&quot;
&quot;No. I did not tell him to go, and after all, I can't say that he did kill
himself. He was all right at luncheon yesterday, which was when I last set eyes
on him. I went to town and returned at five o'clock to hear that he was dead.
One of the servants walking in the park found his body in the ornamental water
at the bottom of the garden.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Did any one push him in?&quot; asked Mrs. Bolstreath.
&quot;I think not. He was on good terms with the servants, although not popular in
any way. No one in my employment would have murdered him, and, as the gates were
closed and no one called between luncheon and five o'clock yesterday, it is
quite certain that he was not murdered by a stranger. In fact, I don't believe
he was murdered at all.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Suicide, then?&quot; suggested Dan once more, and again
Curberry looked at him unpleasantly, as if not relishing the idea. &quot;So far as I
saw he had no intention of committing suicide,&quot; he said in a cold manner,
&quot;however, the evidence at the inquest will settle the matter.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I expect he
didn't look where he was going and fell in,&quot; said Lillian suddenly. &quot;Mr. Penn
was always absent-minded you know.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I frequently found him so,&quot; remarked
Curberry grimly. &quot;He made a great mess of his work occasionally. I am inclined
to agree with you, Miss Moon.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Well,&quot; said Dan, after a pause, &quot;let us settle
that Penn fell in by accident until we hear the verdict of the jury. When does
the inquest take place?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;In another hour,&quot; responded the host, glancing at his
watch. &quot;I was just impressing upon Miss Moon the necessity of returning home
when you arrived. I have to be present, of course, so as to state what I know of
Penn.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;You will give him a good character?&quot; asked Halliday pointedly. Curberry
stared in a supercilious way. &quot;The best of characters,&quot; he said. &quot;I had no fault
to find with him save that he was absent-minded, a quality which no doubt
accounts for his death, poor chap.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Well, well, it's all very sad,&quot; said Mrs.
Bolstreath in a matter of fact way, &quot;but all our talking will not bring the poor
man back. Lillian, child, we must go home, now that your curiosity is satisfied.
But first I shall ask Lord Curberry to give me some of those hot-house flowers I
see yonder,&quot; and she nodded toward a conservatory, which could be entered from
the drawing-room by means of a French window. &quot;Oh, I shall be charmed,&quot; said
Curberry with alacrity, &quot;and perhaps Miss Moon will come also to choose the
flowers.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I can wait here,&quot; replied Lillian carelessly. &quot;I have every
confidence in Mrs. Bolstreath's choice.&quot; Curberry scowled at Dan, for he
understood well enough that Lillian wished to remain with his rival. However, he
could make no further objection without appearing rude, so he moved reluctantly
toward the conservatory beside the chaperon. Yet Dan saw plainly that he was
determined not to lose sight of the two, for he plucked the flowers which were
directly in front of the French window, and thus could gain a view of the young
couple every now and then, when facing round to speak with Mrs. Bolstreath.
Lillian noticed this espionage, also, and whispered to Dan, who had sauntered
across the room close to her elbow. &quot;He won't let us out of his sight,&quot; said
Lillian rapidly, &quot;and I can't get to the library, although I have been trying
all the time.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Why do you wish to get to the library?&quot; asked Dan in a low
voice. Lillian rose suddenly and dropped a piece of paper. &quot;Put your foot on it
and pick it up when he is not looking,&quot; she said swiftly; &quot;hush, he's coming
back,&quot; and then she raised her voice as Curberry returned to the room. &quot;Of
course Mr. Penn was always nervous. I really think his health was bad.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Still
on the disagreeable subject of the death,&quot; remarked Curberry, who had a handful
of flowers to offer. &quot;I wish you wouldn't think of these things, Lillian--I beg
pardon, Miss Moon. Please take these flowers and let me escort you and Mrs.
Bolstreath out of the house. It's atmosphere is uncomfortable just now.&quot; He took
no notice of Dan, but offered his arm to Lillian. With a swift glance at her
lover, at Mrs. Bolstreath, at the room, the flowers, at anything save Dan's
right foot, which was placed firmly on the scrap of paper, she accepted his
offer. The chaperon followed, and when Curberry's back was turned she noticed
that Halliday stooped swiftly to pick up the paper. But that he gave her a
warning glance she would have asked an indiscreet question. As it was she went
after her host and pupil, walking beside Dan, who had now slipped the paper into
his trousers pocket. But Mrs. Bolstreath could not restrain her curiosity
altogether. &quot;What is it?&quot; she whispered, as they walked into the entrance hall.
&quot;Nothing! Nothing!&quot; he replied softly, &quot;take Lillian home at once. I shall
follow later,&quot; and with this Mrs. Bolstreath was obliged to be content, although
she was desperately anxious to know more. &quot;I wish I could escort you home,&quot; said
Curberry, as the two ladies and he stood on the steps, &quot;but my duty keeps me
here for the inquest. Perhaps Mr. Halliday will oblige.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I am afraid not,&quot; said
Dan stolidly. &quot;I promised to meet my friend Mr. Laurance here. He is coming
about the matter of Penn's death. Why, there he is,&quot; and sure enough, at a
moment that could not have been better chosen, Freddy appeared up the avenue.
&quot;Well,&quot; said Mrs. Bolstreath, catching a significant glance from Dan. &quot;We are
not able to wait and chat. Lord Curberry, we detain you.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;No! no! Let me walk
for some distance with you,&quot; cried Curberry, and bareheaded as he was he
strolled down the avenue between the two ladies. Laurance took off his hat and
Lillian bowed graciously, as did Mrs. Bolstreath. But Lord Curberry took no
notice of the reporter beyond a rude stare. &quot;That's just as it should be,&quot;
remarked Halliday, watching the man's retreating form, while Freddy came up to
him, &quot;you're just the man we want.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;We?&quot; echoed Laurance, glancing round.
&quot;Lillian and myself. See here, this is the note sent by Penn to her, and it asks
her to do something which she has not been able to accomplish owing to our noble
friend's vigilance.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;What's that?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I'm just going to find out. I haven't read
the note as yet,&quot; and with a second glance to make sure that Curberry was at a
safe distance Dan opened the piece of paper, and read it hurriedly. A moment
later he slipped it again into his pocket and took Freddy's arm. &quot;It's only a
few lines saying that Penn has left a document which he wishes Lillian to read.
It is to be found between the pages of the second volume of Gibbon's 'Decline
and Fall.' Hum! So that is why Lillian wished to get into the library.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Let me
go,&quot; said Freddy eagerly. &quot;No! no! You catch Curberry as he returns and keep him
in conversation on some plea or other. Then I can slip into the house and seek
the library without being noticed.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Won't the servants----&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Oh, the house is
all upset this day with the inquest, and every one is wandering about more or
less at large. I'll chance it.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;But if Lord Curberry asks for you?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Say that I
am in the library and that I am waiting to have an interview.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;On what
subject?&quot; asked Laurance, rather puzzled by this scheming. &quot;I'll find the
subject,&quot; said Dan, retreating toward the door of the house; &quot;all I want is five
minutes in the library to find the confession. Detain Curberry for that time.
Here he is coming back and here I am going forward.&quot; As he spoke Dan vanished
into the house and came face to face with the butler. &quot;I am waiting for Lord
Curberry,&quot; said Dan, &quot;will you show me into the library, please.&quot; Suspecting
nothing wrong and impressed by Dan's cool manner, the butler conducted him to
the room in question, and after intimating that he would tell his lordship,
departed, closing the door. Halliday ran his eye round the shelves, which
extended on three sides of the large compartment from floor to ceiling. It
seemed impossible to find the book he was in search of, in so short space of
time as would probably be at his disposal. He wished that Penn had indicated the
position of Gibbon's masterpiece. However, Halliday, by a stroke of luck,
suddenly realized that Curberry numbered his shelves alphabetically, and
catalogued his books, so to speak, by the initial letter of the author's name.
Those beginning with &quot;A&quot; were placed on the shelf, ticketed with that letter, as
Allison, Allen, Anderson, and so on, while the shelf &quot;B&quot; contained Browning,
Bronte, Burns, and others. Going by this way of finding the whereabouts of
books, Dan discovered Gibbon's &quot;Decline and Fall&quot; on shelf &quot;G&quot; and laid his hand
on the second volume. But as luck would have it, Lord Curberry suddenly entered
the room just as he was about to open it. Halliday looked up, retaining the
volume in his hand. &quot;I am rather surprised to see you here, Mr. Halliday,&quot; said
Curberry in a cold and haughty tone, &quot;you know that I am busy with this inquest
and have no time for conversation. Besides,&quot; he looked hard at his visitor, &quot;you
could have explained your business out of doors.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Not in the presence of the
ladies,&quot; said Dan promptly; &quot;however, I won't keep you more than five minutes,&quot;
and he wondered how he was to secure the confession without the knowledge of his
host. &quot;I am waiting to hear what you have to say,&quot; said Curberry, throwing his
lean figure into a chair, &quot;you have been making yourself at home,&quot; he added with
a sneer, glancing at the book. Dan laid it on the table. &quot;I took up Gibbon's
second volume just to pass the time,&quot; said he carelessly, &quot;I apologize if you
think me presuming.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I don't think anything,&quot; rejoined Curberry with a shrug,
&quot;except that I am anxious to know why you desire a private conversation.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;It is
about Lillian----&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Miss Moon, if you please.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Lillian to me, Lord Curberry.&quot;
&quot;Nothing of the sort, sir,&quot; cried the other suitor furiously, and his pale eyes
grew angry. &quot;Sir John Moon wishes me to marry his niece.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Probably, but his
niece wishes to marry me.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;That she shall never do.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Oh, I think so. And what
I wish to say, Lord Curberry, is this--that you annoy Miss Moon with your
attentions. They must cease.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;How dare you; how dare you; how dare you!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Oh, I
dare anything where Lillian is concerned,&quot; retorted Halliday, and again in a
careless manner took up the book, leaning against the table and crossing his
legs as he did so. &quot;Leave my house,&quot; cried Curberry, starting to his feet, for
this nonchalant behavior irritated him greatly. &quot;Oh, willingly. I simply stayed
to warn you that Lillian must not be annoyed by you in any way.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;And if I do
not obey you?&quot; sneered the other, quivering with rage. &quot;I shall make myself
unpleasant, Lord Curberry.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Do you know to whom you are speaking?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Well,&quot; said
Dan slowly, and with a keen glance at the angry face, &quot;I am not quite sure. I am
not Asmodeus to unroof houses, you know.&quot; Curberry's yellow face suddenly became
white, and his lips trembled nervously. &quot;I don't understand you.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I scarcely
understand myself, and----&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Wait,&quot; interrupted Curberry, as a knock came to the
door, &quot;there is no need to let every one overhear our conversation. Come in!&quot; he
cried aloud. The butler entered. &quot;You are wanted at the inquest, my lord,&quot; he
said, and as Curberry's face was bent inquiringly on that of the servant, Dan
seized the opportunity to slip a stiff sheaf of papers out of the Gibbon volume.
As a matter of fact, it was three or four sheets joined at the corner by a brass
clasp. Scarcely had he got it in his hand when Curberry wheeled, after hurriedly
telling the butler that he would come shortly. &quot;What have you there?&quot; demanded
the host, advancing menacingly. &quot;Some papers of mine,&quot; said Dan, preparing to
put the sheets into his pocket. &quot;It's a lie. You must have taken them from the
table, or out of that book, Mr. Halliday. Yes, I am sure you did. Give me what
you have taken.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;No,&quot; said Dan, retreating before Curberry's advance, &quot;you are
not to----&quot; Before he could get another word, the man flung himself forward and
made a snatch at the papers. Held loosely by the corner clasp they flew into a
kind of fan, and Curberry managed to grip one or two of the sheets. In the
momentary struggle these were torn away, and then the owner of the house
released himself suddenly. The next moment he had flung the sheets into the
fire, apparently thinking he had got them all. Dan cleverly thrust the one or
two remaining sheets into his pocket, and played the part of a man who has been
robbed. &quot;How dare you destroy my papers,&quot; he cried indignantly. &quot;They were
mine,&quot; said Curberry, gasping with relief, &quot;and now they are burnt.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;They were
Penn's,&quot; retorted Halliday sharply, &quot;perhaps that is why they have been
destroyed by you.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;What do you mean; what do you mean?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Never mind. I think
you understand.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I don't. I swear I don't.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;In that case,&quot; said Dan slowly,
&quot;you can make public the fact that I came into your library to find a document
in the second volume of Gibbon, which was placed there by Marcus Penn. But you
won't, Lord Curberry.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;If the papers were not destroyed, I would place them
before the Coroner at once,&quot; said Curberry, wiping his face and with a glance at
the fire on which fluttered a few black shreds--all that remained of what he had
thrown in. &quot;I think you must be mad to talk as you do.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;If I am, why not make
the matter public?&quot; asked Dan drily. &quot;I don't care about a scandal,&quot; said
Curberry loftily. &quot;Well,&quot; Halliday retreated to the library door, &quot;perhaps the
death of Penn will be scandal enough. Those papers doubtless contained an
account of the reasons which led to his death.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I'm sorry that I burnt them
then,&quot; said Curberry in a studied tone of regret. &quot;I am an impulsive man, Mr.
Halliday, and you should not have annoyed me in the way you did. How did you
know that the papers were in the second volume of Gibbon?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Never mind.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Were
they addressed to you?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Never mind.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;What were they about?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Never mind!&quot;
&quot;D---- you, sir, how dare you?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Good-day, Lord Curberry,&quot; interrupted Dan, and
walked out of the room, leaving his host looking the picture of consternation
and dread.</p>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<h4>CHAPTER XV.</h4>
<h5><a name="div1_15" href="#div1Ref_15">ABSOLUTE PROOF</a></h5>
<br>

<p>It did not require a particularly clever
man to guess that Lord Curberry was connected with the Society of Flies. Had he
been entirely ignorant of that association, he would not have displayed such
agitation when he saw the papers in Dan's hand, nor would he have struggled to
gain possession of them, much less have destroyed them. Penn certainly was one
of the gang, and on that account, probably Curberry had engaged him as a
secretary after the death of Moon. Also he may have had some suspicion that Penn
was a traitor, and had guessed that the papers betrayed the society. Otherwise,
he would have placed the same before the Coroner, so as to elucidate the reason
why the secretary had been done to death. That he had been, Halliday was quite
convinced, as Penn was too nervous a man to commit suicide and must have been
assisted out of the world by some other person. &quot;But the verdict of suicide has
been brought in,&quot; argued Laurance, when Dan related his adventure. &quot;I daresay.
Curberry's evidence was to the effect that Penn had been considerably worried of
late. Of course, that is true, but he wouldn't have killed himself, I'll swear.
However,&quot; Dan chuckled, &quot;I have a sheet or two remaining of the confession, and
we may learn much from that.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Will it state that Curberry belonged to Queen
Beelzebub's gang?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I think so. If Curberry does not, he would have made a row
and kicked me out of the house. I had no business in the library and no right to
take the papers, you know. But I defied Curberry to create a scandal, and left
him in a pleasing state of uncertainty as to what I knew and what I intended to
do. He was green with fright.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;You had better take care, Dan, or the society
will murder you,&quot; warned Laurance in an uneasy tone. &quot;Oh, I'm safe enough for
the given month,&quot; returned Halliday positively; &quot;so far I have said nothing, and
until I do notify the authorities all will be well with me.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;But Miss Moon?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I
join her and Mrs. Bolstreath, at St. Pancras this evening, to catch the six
o'clock express to Thawley. Have you written to Miss Vincent?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yes. There is no
time to receive a reply, but she is aware that the ladies will stay at The
Peacock Hotel, Sheepeak, under the wing of Mrs. Pelgrin. I only hope,&quot; added
Freddy emphatically, &quot;that you are doing right in placing Miss Moon in the
lion's mouth.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Under the guns of the enemy, you said before. Oh, yes, I am
right, especially that I now hold a part of Penn's confession. I shall contrive
to let Mrs. Jarsell know that I do, and that if anything happens to Lillian, I
can make it hot for her.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Does the confession implicate Mrs. Jarsell?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yes, it
does. I have not had time to decipher the crooked writing of our late friend,
but intend to do so when in the train this evening. But the little I saw hinted
that Mrs. Jarsell was in the swim.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I wish you would leave the confession with
me,&quot; said Laurance, who was desperately anxious to know the exact truth. &quot;Can't,
my dear fellow, nor have I time to let you read it, even if I had it on me,
which I haven't. My taxi is at the door of this office, and I'm off to St.
Pancras in five minutes. Remember, Freddy, that this confession is my sole
weapon to protect Lillian. When Mrs. Jarsell learns that I have it, she will not
dare to move, and will keep her subjects off the grass also.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;But Curberry will
tell her that he has destroyed the confession.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;So he thinks,&quot; chuckled
Halliday, &quot;but I shall tell her that I rescued enough of it to damn her and her
precious gang.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;But how can you tell her without danger?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I shall find a way,
although I haven't formulated any scheme as yet. Perhaps she will ask me what
all this--the story of Queen Beelzebub you know--has to do with her. I shall
reply that it has nothing to do with her, but that I know she desires to assist
in my love affair. Oh, I'll manage somehow, old son, you may be certain.
Good-by.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Wait a moment,&quot; said Laurance, following Dan to the door, &quot;what about
Sir John Moon? He will make a row over Lillian's flight, and you will get into
trouble.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;He may make a row if he likes, but as Lillian is under the wing of
Mrs. Bolstreath, her duly-appointed chaperon, I don't see what he can say. She
is quite ready to take all blame.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Of course,&quot; said Laurance thoughtfully, &quot;Sir
John may belong to the society himself, in which case, like Curberry, he dare
not make a row.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;No,&quot; rejoined Dan positively, &quot;I don't believe Sir John
belongs to the gang. I wish he did, as it would smooth things. Curberry dare not
make open trouble, because he is one of Queen Beelzebub's subjects, but Sir John
may because he isn't. However, I shall risk taking Lillian away with Mrs.
Bolstreath to play the part of dragon, and Sir John can do what he jolly well
likes. Luckily, he is in the country on a visit just now, so we can get clear
away without a fuss. By the way, you were at the inquest. Was there any fly
found on Penn's body, or was there mention of any scent?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;No. The man was
drowned, and it was not possible for either scent or fly to be on his corpse or
clothes. The evidence clearly pointed to suicide.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;H'm. Curberry brought that
about,&quot; said Dan grimly; &quot;however, I am jolly well sure that Penn was murdered
by one of the gang.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Not by Curberry. He was away at the time of the death.&quot;
&quot;Perhaps. I'd like to be certain of that. But in any case, he may have others of
the gang in his employment, who could polish off the traitor. Queen Beelzebub's
subjects are of all classes. Well, I'm off.&quot; Halliday took his way to St.
Pancras forthwith, and found Mrs. Bolstreath and her charge waiting for him.
Lillian was greatly excited and curious, as she did not yet know the reason for
this sudden trip northward. Instructed by Dan, the chaperon had refused to
impart knowledge, as the young man intended to tell the girl everything when
they were in the train. However, Miss Moon was enjoying the unexpected journey
and had every faith in her companion. Also, so long as she was in Dan's company,
she did not care where she went, or why she went, or when she went. She loved
Halliday too completely for there to be any room for distrust in her mind.
&quot;Dan,&quot; said Mrs. Bolstreath, when they were stepping into the first-class
compartment which Halliday had wired to reserve to themselves. &quot;I have written
to Sir John saying that Lillian required a change, and that I was taking her to
Hillshire, to see some friends of mine. When he has this explanation he will not
make any trouble, or even any inquiries. He has every trust in me.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Good,&quot; said
Dan, heartily, &quot;you make an excellent conspirator.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Conspirator,&quot; echoed
Lillian, gaily, &quot;now what does that mysterious word mean, Dan? I am quite in the
dark.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;You shall know all before we get to Thawley. Make yourself comfortable!&quot;
&quot;Do we stay at Thawley?&quot; asked the girl, arranging her rug. &quot;For the night. I
have telegraphed, engaging rooms for you and Mrs. Bolstreath at the best hotel.
To-morrow we go to Sheepeak.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Where is that?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Some miles from Thawley. You
must live quietly for a short time, Lillian.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;It's all immensely exciting, of
course,&quot; cried Miss Moon, petulantly, &quot;but I should like to know what it all
means.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Patience! Patience!&quot; said Dan in a teasing tone, &quot;little girls should
be content to wait. By Jove, we're off.&quot; The long train glided out of the
station, gathering impetus as it left the lights of London behind. Mrs.
Bolstreath made herself comfortable in one corner of the compartment, and
Lillian did the same in another corner, while Dan sat on the opposite seat and
addressed his conversation to both impartially. The girl could scarcely restrain
her impatience, so anxious was she to learn the reason for this unexpected
journey. &quot;Now, Dan, now!&quot; she cried, clapping her hands, &quot;there is no stop until
Bedford, so we have plenty of time to hear the story.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;One minute,&quot; said
Halliday, who was now in possession of the three sheets of foolscap, which he
had rescued from Curberry's grip, &quot;I must bring the story up to date, and cannot
do so until I read this statement. By the way, Lillian, why should he send to
you about the matter?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I'm sure I don't know. But, of course, he knew how
grieved I was over my father's murder, and perhaps wished to set my mind at
rest.&quot; Dan looked at her curiously. &quot;Why should you think that Penn knew of
anything likely to set your mind at rest on that point?&quot; Lillian cast down her
eyes thoughtfully. &quot;I always thought that Mr. Penn knew much more than he would
confess about poor father's death. I quite forgot that I thought so until I got
the letter asking me to look into the second volume of Gibbon's 'Decline and
Fall' in Lord Curberry's library. Dear me!&quot; murmured the girl, folding her
hands, &quot;how I did try to get into the library.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Curberry would not let you?&quot;
&quot;No, I think he was puzzled why I wished to go. But he did not ask me any
questions.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I quite believe that,&quot; said Dan, grimly; &quot;asking questions was a
dangerous game for him to play. However, when he found me in the library, he
evidently recalled your desire to go there, and it flashed across him that we
were working in consort. No wonder he destroyed the papers on the chance that
Penn might have left incriminating evidence behind him.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I don't know what you
are talking about,&quot; said Lillian, fretfully. &quot;Well,&quot; observed Dan, smoothing out
the foolscap, &quot;Penn, no doubt, left the clue as to the whereabouts of the
confession to you, so that you might learn who murdered your father.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Ah, I
always believed Mr. Penn knew. Is the name in that paper?&quot; she asked eagerly,
and leaning forward. &quot;It may or it may not be, dear. You see the greater part of
the confession was destroyed by Lord Curberry. He was afraid.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Dan!&quot; Lillian
caught her lover's hand, &quot;you don't think that Lord Curberry killed my father?&quot;
&quot;No, no, no!&quot; said Halliday, quickly. &quot;I am sure he did not. However, you shall
hear all that I know, and Laurance knows, and all that Mrs. Bolstreath is
acquainted with. Only let me read these few sheets first.&quot; The girl, on fire
with curiosity, would have objected, but that Mrs. Bolstreath touched her
shoulder significantly. With an effort to restrain her curiosity, which was
creditable considering the circumstances, she nestled into her corner of the
carriage, while Dan glanced through the manuscript. In spite of Penn's crooked
handwriting--and it was very bad indeed--it did not take much time for the young
man to master the contents of the confession. He uttered an exclamation of
vexation when he reached the end. &quot;Like a serial story, it breaks off at the
most interesting part,&quot; he said crossly. &quot;However, I have learned something.&quot;
&quot;What have you learned?&quot; demanded Mrs. Bolstreath immediately. &quot;All in good
time,&quot; said Halliday, quietly. &quot;I must first tell Lillian what we both know, and
then I can bring our discoveries up to date by saying what is in this
confession,&quot; and he tapped his breast-pocket, wherein he had placed the sheets.
&quot;Now then, Lillian.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Now then, Dan,&quot; she mocked, &quot;just tell me all, for I
cannot keep silence any longer.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;You will have to, if you desire to hear the
story. Only don't be worried by what I am about to tell you. You are safe with
me.&quot; Lillian shrugged her shoulders, as if to imply that there was no need for
him to state such a plain truth, and looked at him with inquiring eyes. As she
appeared to be brave and collected, Dan had no hesitation in relating to her all
that he had already told Mrs. Bolstreath, and thus the girl became thoroughly
informed of the underhand doings which had taken place since the death of her
father. As Halliday explained, her eyes became larger and rounder and more
shining. Still the color did not leave her cheeks and although she was intensely
interested she did not display any fright. This was creditable to her courage,
considering that the revelation hinted at many possible dangers to herself and
to her lover. Dan brought the story up to the time they started from London, and
then waited to hear her opinion. &quot;It's dreadful and wonderful, and very horrid,&quot;
said Lillian, drawing a deep breath; &quot;do you think that Mr. Penn murdered my
father?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;No. The evidence of the girl to whom he was dictating letters to be
typewritten proves that he did not enter the library at the time when the death
was supposed to have taken place.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Then Lord Curberry? He----&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I don't believe
Lord Curberry, either directly or indirectly, had anything to do with the
matter,&quot; said Dan, decisively. &quot;Sir Charles approved of his suit rather than of
mine, so it was to Curberry's interest to keep your father alive and well. My
dear, it was the false Mrs. Brown who killed Sir Charles, and she came as an
agent of this ghastly Society of Flies, because he got to know too much about
the association.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Then Mrs. Brown is Mrs. Jarsell?&quot; asked Mrs. Bolstreath,
anxiously. &quot;I can't be sure of that,&quot; said the young man, thoughtfully; &quot;of
course, the sole evidence that proves Mrs. Jarsell to be connected with the gang
is the presence of the Sumatra scent in her Hillshire house, and her presence on
the Blackheath grounds when Durwin was murdered.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;But, by your own showing, she
could not have reached London in time.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;That is quite true and yet I recognized
her plainly enough on the day Lillian and I saw the animated pictures. However,
we can leave that fact alone for the moment. I am certain that Mrs. Jarsell is
Queen Beelzebub, for Penn says as much.&quot; He tapped his breast-pocket again.
&quot;Oh,&quot; cried Lillian, eagerly, &quot;what does the confession say?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I'll give you the
gist of it,&quot; replied Halliday, quietly. &quot;Penn begins with a statement of his
early life. He was the son of a clergyman, and his mother is still alive. From a
public school he went to Cambridge, and thence to London, where he tried to make
a living by literature. Not being clever he did not succeed, and fell into low
water. I am bound to say that he did not trouble much about his own poverty, but
seemed to be greatly concerned on account of his mother, who is badly off--so he
says. Then he was tempted and fell, poor devil.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Who tempted him?&quot; demanded
Mrs. Bolstreath. &quot;A young man whom he met when he was staying in a Bloomsbury
boarding-house, very hard up. The man said that he belonged to a society which
could make its members rich, and proposed to introduce Penn. This was done, in
the same way, I presume, in which I was taken to these mysterious headquarters.
The first fruits of Penn's connection with Queen Beelzebub was that Sir Charles
Moon engaged him as secretary, so, getting a good salary, he was enabled to give
his mother many comforts.&quot; Lillian looked alarmed. &quot;But my father did not belong
to the association.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;No. Of course he didn't. But Penn was placed as his
secretary--the business was managed through Curberry, who <i>does</i> belong to the
gang--so that he might inveigle Sir Charles into becoming a member. Penn appears
to have lost his nerve, and did not dare to persuade Sir Charles, so another
person was put on to the business. The name is not given.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;But why did Queen
Beelzebub wish my father to belong to the gang?&quot; asked Lillian, with natural
perplexity. &quot;The reason is plain, my dear. Sir Charles was an influential man,
and could be of great service to the association. He learned enough to show him
what a dangerous organization existed, and then sent for Mr. Durwin, who
belonged to New Scotland Yard, so that he might reveal what he knew. Penn
learned this, since he saw the letter written by your father, Lillian, and at
once told the society. Then the false Mrs. Brown was sent to stop Sir Charles,
and----&quot; Dan made an eloquent gesture with his hands. There did not seem to be
much need of further explanation. &quot;Mrs. Brown undoubtedly murdered Sir Charles,&quot;
commented Mrs. Bolstreath, in a thoughtful way, &quot;but is she Mrs. Jarsell?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Penn
says as much,&quot; repeated Dan, who had made the same remark earlier, &quot;but it is
just at that point he ends. Listen and I shall read you the last sentence,&quot; and
Halliday took the papers from his pocket. The three sheets were intact, as
Curberry did only rend away the remainder from the brass clasp. At the end of
the third page Halliday read, &quot;Mrs. Jarsell of the Grange, Hillshire, can
explain how Mrs.----&quot; Dan broke off with a frown. &quot;Here we come to the end of
the page, and can learn no more. Curberry burnt the most important part of the
confession, which doubtless gave full details of Mrs. Jarsell's connection with
the gang.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;She could explain about Mrs. Brown, I suppose,&quot; said Lillian,
quietly. &quot;Yes. The first word over the page is, I am certain, Brown. What is
more, I believe Mrs. Jarsell and Mrs. Brown are one and the same.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;If I see
Mrs. Jarsell, I may recognize her, Dan. I saw the false Mrs. Brown, remember,
and it was because of me that she was admitted to an interview with my father.&quot;
&quot;If you do recognize her, which I doubt, you must not let on you know who she
really is,&quot; Dan warned the girl; &quot;our business just now, and until we get more
evidence, is to pretend entire ignorance of these things. You are up in
Hillshire for a change of air, Lillian, and know nothing. Mrs. Jarsell, relying
on the clever way in which she was disguised, will never dream that you connect
her with the poor woman who came on that fatal night to see your father. You
understand?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Quite,&quot; put in Mrs. Bolstreath, before the girl could speak, &quot;and
I shall see that Lillian acts her part of knowing nothing.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Remember you deal
with an extraordinarily clever woman, Mrs. Bolstreath.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I am a woman also, so
diamond can cut diamond.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;But, Dan,&quot; asked Lillian, timidly, &quot;do you think that
Mrs. Jarsell really did murder my father?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;On what evidence we have, I believe
she did. She murdered your father and Durwin because they knew too much, and I
should not be surprised to learn, in spite of the verdict at the inquest, that
she got rid of Penn.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Why should she?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Penn let out too much to me,&quot; explained
Dan, putting away the confession, &quot;and, in any case, was a weak sort of chap,
who was a source of danger to the society. Queen Beelzebub, who is, I believe,
Mrs. Jarsell, evidently thought it was best to silence him. I am sure that Penn
did not commit suicide, and was drowned by Mrs. Jarsell. Still, in the absence
of further evidence, we can do nothing.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;What action will you take now?&quot; asked
Mrs. Bolstreath, quickly. &quot;Before leaving Thawley to-morrow morning,&quot; said
Halliday, after a pause, &quot;I shall post this confession to Laurance, and tell him
to make use of it only should he hear that anything happens to me.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Or to me,&quot;
chimed in Lillian, and looked a trifle nervous. &quot;My dear, nothing can happen to
you,&quot; said Dan, decidedly, &quot;cheek by jowl, as it were, with Mrs. Jarsell, you
are perfectly safe. Queen Beelzebub confines her doings to London and keeps the
name of Mrs. Jarsell clean in Hillshire, for obvious reasons. The Grange is her
place of refuge, and no one would connect an innocent country lady with criminal
doings in London. If she is what we think her to be, she will not hurt a hair of
your head in Hillshire.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;All the same, I don't intend to see her,&quot; said
Lillian, determinedly. &quot;There is no reason that you should. She may call and try
to learn why you are staying at the Peacock Hotel, and, if so, will probably ask
you to The Grange. Don't go,&quot; ended Dan, emphatically. &quot;Of course not,&quot; put in
Mrs. Bolstreath, equally decisive, &quot;leave that to me, since I am responsible for
Lillian.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;You can say that I am ill with nerves or consumption, or something,&quot;
said the girl, vaguely. &quot;I don't want to meet the woman if she murdered my
father.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;If you do,&quot; said Dan, impressively, &quot;don't reveal your suspicions,&quot;
and then he went on to instruct the two ladies how they were to behave in the
enemy's country. That they were safe there, so long as they pretended ignorance,
Dan did not doubt, but, should Mrs. Jarsell learn that they knew so much about
her, she might adopt a counsel of despair and strike. It did not do to drive so
dangerous a woman into a corner. For the rest of the journey very little was
said. The subject had been thoroughly threshed out. Lillian had been informed of
what was going on, and all plans had been made for the future. The girl was to
live at the Peacock and see Miss Vincent, and chat with Mrs. Pelgrin, and take
walks and admire the country, and to conduct herself generally as one who came
simply for a change of air. If she did not go to The Grange--and on the plea of
illness, she could excuse herself from going--Mrs. Jarsell could not harm her in
any way. And, indeed, even if Mrs. Jarsell did succeed in getting her to come to
afternoon tea, Dan had a plan in his head whereby to ensure Lillian against any
use being made of the Sumatra scent. It was a daring thing to take Miss Moon
into the jaws of the lion, yet that very daring would probably prove to be her
safeguard. But Halliday had done what he could to guard against the events of a
threatening future, and now could only wait to see what would take place. At the
moment there was nothing more to be done. In due course the train arrived at
Thawley Station, and Dan singled out George Pelgrin to convey luggage to a cab.
Mindful of his last tip, George displayed great alacrity in performing his
duties as porter, and, what is more, when he received another half-crown gave
inadvertently a piece of valuable information, which Halliday was far from
expecting. &quot;That's the second two-and-six since yesterday,&quot; said George,
spitting on the coin for luck. &quot;Mrs. Jarsell gave me the same when she came back
yesterday evening.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Oh,&quot; Dan was startled, but did not show it, &quot;your Sheepeak
friend has been to London then?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Went a couple of days ago, and came back last
night,&quot; said Pelgrin, &quot;and she says to me, 'George, look after my traps, for
you're the only smart porter in this station,' she says. Ah, she's a kind lady
is Mrs. Jarsell, and that civil as never was. There's the luggage in the cab all
right, sir. The Vulcan Hotel? Yes, sir. Drive on, cabby.&quot; Mrs. Bolstreath and
Lillian had not heard this conversation, but Dan pondered over it on the way to
the hotel. Mrs. Jarsell had, then, been in London at the time of Penn's death,
and probably--although he could not prove this--she was responsible for the
same. When the young man arrived at the hotel, and the ladies went to rest, he
wrote a letter to Laurance, detailing the new fact he had learned, and
instructed him what use to make of the confession if anything happened to
himself in Hillshire. Then he enclosed the confession and went out personally to
register the packet. Once it was posted he felt that he had done all that was
possible. &quot;And now,&quot; said Dan, to himself, &quot;we'll see what move Queen Beelzebub
will make.&quot;</p>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<h4>CHAPTER XVI</h4>
<h5><a name="div1_16" href="#div1Ref_16">DAN'S DIPLOMACY</a></h5>
<br>

<p>Mrs. Pelgrin welcomed her unexpected
guests with great delight and showed her appreciation of their coming by
emphatic aggressiveness. Why she should mask a kind heart and an excellent
disposition by assuming a brusque demeanor is not very clear, but certainly the
more amiable she felt the more disagreeable did she become. In fact, the
landlady appeared to believe that honesty of purpose was best shown by blunt
speeches and abrupt movements. Consequently, she did not get on particularly
well with Mrs. Bolstreath, who demanded respect and deference from underlings,
which Mrs. Pelgrin positively declined to render. She termed the chaperon &quot;a
fine madam,&quot; in the same spirit as she had called Dan &quot;a butterfly,&quot; and was
always ready for a war of words. But, admiring Lillian's gay and lively
character, she waited on the girl hand and foot, yet with an air of protest to
hide the real satisfaction she felt at having her in the house. To Mrs. Pelgrin,
Lillian was a goddess who had descended from high Olympus to mingle for a time
with mere mortals. Out of consideration for Halliday's desire to seek safety for
Lillian by placing her under the guns of the enemy, Mrs. Bolstreath decided to
remain a week at the Peacock Hotel. Later she arranged to go to Hartlepool in
Durhamshire, where she and her charge could find shelter with two spinsters who
kept a school. The chaperon admitted that she felt uneasy in the near vicinity
of Queen Beelzebub, and all Dan's assurance could not quieten her fears. She
thought that he was playing too bold a game, and that ill would come of the stay
at Sheepeak. Lillian was more confident, always confident that Dan could do no
wrong, and she was quite indifferent to Mrs. Jarsell's doings. However, she
agreed to go to Hartlepool, and as Mrs. Bolstreath was bent upon the change,
Halliday accepted the situation. Meanwhile, he decided to call at The Grange on
some innocent pretext and diplomatically give Queen Beelzebub to understand that
he held the winning card in the game he was playing with the Society of Flies.
This could be done, he ventured to think, by assuming that Mrs. Jarsell knew
nothing about the nefarious association, and he did not believe that she would
remove her mask, since it was to her interest to observe secrecy in Hillshire.
However, he left this matter of a call and an explanation in abeyance for the
time being, and for a couple of days attended to the three ladies. The third, it
is needless to say, was Mildred Vincent, who called at The Peacock Hotel on
receipt of her lover's letter. She gave Dan to understand that he was out of
favor with the inventor. &quot;Uncle has never forgiven you for not winning the
race,&quot; said Mildred, at afternoon tea, &quot;he says you should have gained the
prize.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I wish I had,&quot; said Halliday, dryly, &quot;the money would have been very
acceptable. It was my fancy-flying did the mischief, as I broke the rudder.
However, I shall call and apologize.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;He won't see you, Mr. Halliday.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Ah,
that's so like an inventor, who is as touchy as a minor poet.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Mrs. Jarsell is
annoyed also,&quot; continued Mildred, sadly, &quot;she says you should have made a better
use of the favor she procured for you.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;It seems to me that I am in hot water
all round, Miss Vincent. All the same, I shall survive these dislikes.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;It is
absurd,&quot; cried Lillian, with indignation. &quot;Dan risked his life to win the race,
and if he hadn't had such bad luck he would have won.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Thanks, my dear girl,
but it was less bad luck than carelessness, and a certain amount of vanity, to
show how I could handle the machine.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;You are very modest, Dan,&quot; said Mrs.
Bolstreath, laughingly. &quot;It is my best quality,&quot; replied Halliday, with a
twinkle in his eyes. &quot;Where is Mr. Vincent's machine now?&quot; questioned Mildred.
&quot;At Blackheath stored away. I suppose, as it was only lent, I shall have to
return it to your uncle. But I shall have a final fly on it when I go back to
London in a few days.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Does Miss Moon go back also?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Not to London,&quot;
interposed Mrs. Bolstreath, &quot;we propose to visit some friends in Scotland.&quot;
Lillian looked up in surprise, as Hartlepool certainly was not in Scotland, and
she thought that Mrs. Bolstreath's geography was at fault. But a significant
look from Dan showed her that he understood why the wrong address had been
given. Mrs. Bolstreath, with too much zeal, mistrusted Mildred, although she had
no cause to do so. Certainly Mildred, in perfect innocence, did she know the
actual destination, might tell her uncle, who would assuredly tell Mrs. Jarsell,
and, for obvious reasons, it was not necessary that Mrs. Jarsell should know
where the city of refuge was situated. All the same, Dan did not think for a
moment that Mildred knew anything about the Society of Flies. But he was
beginning to fancy that Vincent had some such knowledge, as Mrs. Jarsell
financed him, and that she would not do so, he was positive, unless she made
something out of the matter. It was very convenient for Queen Beelzebub to have
an inventor at her elbow who could construct swift aeroplanes. And it was at
this point of his meditations that Dan jumped up so suddenly as to spill his
tea. &quot;What's the matter?&quot; asked Lillian, making a dash at the cup and saucer to
save breakage. &quot;I've got an idea,&quot; said Halliday, with a gasp. &quot;I must go out
and think it over,&quot; and, without excusing himself further, he rushed from the
room. &quot;That's not like Dan,&quot; remarked Mrs. Bolstreath, uneasily, &quot;he is calm and
cool-headed as a rule. I wonder what is the matter?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Oh, he'll tell us when he
comes back,&quot; replied Lillian, philosophically. &quot;I can always trust Dan.&quot; Then
she turned the conversation in a somewhat heedless manner. &quot;Do you like living
here, Miss Vincent?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Well,&quot; admitted Mildred, &quot;it is rather too quiet for my
taste. But I have plenty to do in looking after my uncle and his business. He
depends so much on me, that I wonder what he will do when I get married.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;When
do you intend to get married?&quot; asked Mrs. Bolstreath, curiously. She could not
disabuse herself of the idea that, living so close to Mrs. Jarsell, and having
an uncle who was helped by Mrs. Jarsell, the girl knew something about the
Society of Flies. &quot;Next year, the year after--I don't exactly know. It all
depends upon my dear Freddy's success. We must have a home and an income. But I
suppose we shall marry, sooner or later, and then Mrs. Jarsell can look after
Uncle Solomon.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Who is Mrs. Jarsell?&quot; asked Lillian, artfully and cautiously.
&quot;She is an old lady who lives at The Grange with another old lady, her former
governess, Miss Armour. Both are charming. If you are dull here, perhaps, Miss
Moon, you would like to meet them?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Later, later,&quot; put in Mrs. Bolstreath,
hurriedly, &quot;thank you for the suggestion, Miss Vincent. Meanwhile, we wish to
explore the country. It is a charming neighborhood, although very quiet in many
respects.&quot; Mildred agreed and then began to plan excursions to this place and
that, with the idea of making the stay of the visitors at Sheepeak pleasant. So
agreeably did she behave and took such trouble in designing trips that Mrs.
Bolstreath revised her opinion and began to believe that so nice a girl could
not possibly know anything of Mrs. Jarsell's doings, whatever knowledge her
uncle might be possessed of. And Dan, walking at top speed along the high road
in a vain attempt to quieten his mind, was convinced that the inventor had some
such knowledge. The idea which had brought him to his feet, and had sent him out
to work off his excitement, was that the inventor was responsible for Mrs.
Jarsell's presence in London at unexpected moments. She financed him and
retained him at her elbow, so to speak, that she might utilize his capabilities
and his clever inventions. If, on the day of the London to York race, Mrs.
Jarsell was at the Peacock Hotel about the hour of nine o'clock--as she
certainly was, on the evidence of Mrs. Pelgrin, who had no obvious reason to
tell a lie--she could not have got to London by train or motor in time to murder
Durwin. Yet she was assuredly at Blackheath, if the cinematograph was to be
believed. Dan had hitherto been puzzled to reconcile apparent impossibilities,
but at tea-time the solution of the problem had suddenly flashed into his mind.
Mrs. Jarsell had travelled to town on an aeroplane. &quot;It is about one hundred and
sixty miles from this place to town,&quot; muttered Dan, walking very fast, and
talking aloud to himself in his excitement, &quot;so she could accomplish that
distance with ease in three hours, considering that Vincent's machine can fly at
sixty miles in sixty minutes. He said so and I proved that he spoke truly when I
experimented with the machine he lent me. Mrs. Jarsell was at the Peacock Hotel
at nine o'clock, and the cinematograph showed she was at Blackheath at one
o'clock. The race started then, and Durwin was killed shortly afterwards. Sixty
miles an hour means one hundred and eighty miles in three hours. Say she started
at half-past nine--which she could easily do, leaving Mrs. Pelgrin immediately
for Vincent's place--she could reach London by half-past twelve, if not earlier,
seeing she had just one hundred and sixty miles to go. There would be no
difficulty in her reaching Blackheath and stabbing Durwin at the time the death
took place.&quot; Halliday was convinced that in this way the miracle of Mrs. Jarsell
had taken place. No other means of transit could have landed her at the place
where Durwin had met with his death. Of course, this assumption intimated that
Mrs. Jarsell was an accomplished aviator, and that there had been no hitch in
the journey from Sheepeak to Blackheath. But these were not impossibilities, for
Vincent probably had taught the woman how to fly, and perhaps had handled the
machine himself. There was room for two in the aeroplane, as Dan very well knew,
since he had taken Penn for a flight himself, and the vehicle used was probably
built on the same lines as the one lent. Since aviation was yet in its infancy,
there was certainly a possibility that such a journey could not take place
without accidents or hindrance. But, as inferior machines had accomplished
greater distances, Dan quite believed that Mrs. Jarsell, with or without Vincent
as pilot, had reached London in one smooth stretch of flying. On other occasions
she might not have been so successful, but on this one she probably had, for to
get to Blackheath in time to commit the crime, it would have been necessary for
her to use rightfully every second of the given time. No wonder with such a
means of transit at her disposal she could prove an advantageous alibi, when
occasion demanded. Also, since the late conquest of the air afforded her the
opportunity of swift travelling, greatly in excess of other human inventions, it
was quite reasonable that she should live so far from the scene of her criminal
exploits. Thinking thus, Halliday stumbled across the very person who was in his
thought. He rushed with bent head along the roads and unconsciously mounted
towards the vast spaces of the moorlands, stretching under gray skies. Thus--and
he swiftly decided that the collision was meant--he ran into Mrs. Jarsell, who
approached in the opposite direction. She laughed and expostulated, as if Dan
was in the wrong, although she must have seen him coming, and the road was wide
enough for her to move to one side. &quot;Really, Mr. Halliday, you require the whole
country to move in,&quot; said Mrs. Jarsell in her heavy way, and with an affectation
of joviality. &quot;I--I--I beg your pardon,&quot; stammered Dan, not quite himself, and
stared at her as though she had suddenly risen out of the earth. Indeed, so far
as he was concerned, she had done so, ignorant as he was of her approach. The
woman was arrayed in her favorite white, but, as the day was chilly, she wore a
voluminous cloak of scarlet silk quilted and padded and warm both in looks and
wear. Her black eyes, set in her olive-hued face, peered from under her white
hair as watchfully as ever. At the present moment, her heavy countenance wore an
expression of amusement at the startled looks of the young man, and she
commented on them with ponderous jocularity. &quot;One would think I was a ghost, Mr.
Halliday. You will admit that I am a very substantial ghost,&quot; and she shook her
silver-mounted cane playfully at him. &quot;I didn't expect to meet you here,&quot; said
Dan, drawing a deep breath, and thinking how best he could introduce the subject
of Lillian. &quot;Nor did I expect to meet you,&quot; responded Mrs. Jarsell, still
phlegmatically playful. &quot;Have you risen from the earth, or dropped from the
skies? I did not even know that you were in the neighborhood.&quot; Dan grimly
decided that this last statement was false, since he had been a whole two days
at the Peacock Hotel, and he was certain Mrs. Jarsell must have heard of his
visit. Also of the ladies sheltering under Mrs. Pelgrin's wing, for in the
country gossip is more prevalent than in town. &quot;I came up for a day or two, or
three or four,&quot; said Dan, still staring. &quot;You don't appear to be very decided in
your own mind,&quot; rejoined Mrs. Jarsell, dryly, and sat down on a large block of
granite, which was embedded amongst the heather; &quot;our neighborhood evidently has
a fascination for you,&quot; her eye searched his face carefully. &quot;I am pleased, as
we are proud of our scenery hereabouts. Those who come once, come twice; quite a
proverb, isn't it? Is your friend, Mr. Laurance, with you?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Not on this
occasion,&quot; answered Dan, coolly, and coming to the point. &quot;I came with two
ladies, Miss Moon and her companion. They are stopping at the Peacock Hotel for
a short time.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Miss Moon! Miss Moon!&quot; mused Mrs. Jarsell, &quot;oh, yes, the young
lady you are engaged to marry. The daughter of that poor man who was murdered.&quot;
&quot;You have an excellent memory, Mrs. Jarsell.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;We have little to exercise our
memories in this dull place,&quot; said the woman graciously, and with a motherly
air, &quot;you don't ask after Miss Armour, I observe. That is very unkind of you, as
you are a great favorite with her.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Miss Armour is my very good friend,&quot;
responded Halliday, cautiously, &quot;and so are you, since you induced Mr. Vincent
to lend me the aeroplane.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I am as glad that I did that as I am sorry you lost
the race, Mr. Halliday.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Fortune of war,&quot; said Dan, lightly, &quot;we can't always
be successful you know, Mrs. Jarsell. I wish you had seen the start; it was
grand.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I wish I had,&quot; said the woman, lying glibly, &quot;but it was impossible for
me to leave Miss Armour on that day, as she had bad health. In fact, Mr. Vincent
wished to go also and see how his machine worked; but he could not get away
either. Still,&quot; added Mrs. Jarsell, with a cheerful air, &quot;perhaps it is as well,
so far as I am concerned, that I could not go. Aviation seems to be very
dangerous, and I should have been afraid for your safety.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Oh, I shall never
come to harm in the air, I hope,&quot; responded Dan, with emphasis, &quot;you must let me
take you up some day.&quot; Mrs. Jarsell shuddered. &quot;I should be terrified out of my
wits,&quot; she protested, &quot;fancy a heavy woman, such as I am, trying to emulate a
bird. Why, I am quite sure I would fall and smash like an egg, even supposing
there is any machine capable of bearing my none too trifling weight.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Oh, I
think there is, Mrs. Jarsell. Some machines can carry two, you know, and lately
in France an aviator took five or six people from one given point to another. It
is quite safe.&quot; Mrs. Jarsell shook her head seriously. &quot;I think not, since
aviation is yet in its infancy. In five years, if I live as long, I may venture,
but now--no, thank you, Mr. Halliday.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Most ladies are afraid, certainly. Even
Miss Moon, who is plucky, will not let me take her for a fly.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Miss Moon, of
course. I was quite forgetting her. I hope you will bring her to see me and Miss
Armour.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;If she stays here, certainly. But I think of returning to town
to-morrow, so I may not be able to bring her. I daresay Mrs. Bolstreath will,
however,&quot; ended Dan, quite certain in his own mind that the chaperon would find
some good excuse to avoid the visit. &quot;I shall be delighted,&quot; Mrs. Jarsell
murmured vaguely, &quot;how have you been, Mr. Halliday, since I saw you last?&quot; It
seemed to Dan that she asked this question with intention, and he was entirely
willing to give her a frank answer. In frankness, as in taking Lillian under the
guns of the enemy, lay the safety of both. Halliday was convinced of this. &quot;I
have been rather worried,&quot; he said, slowly, and with a side-glance at Mrs.
Jarsell's watchful face. &quot;I had an adventure.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I love adventures,&quot; replied the
woman, heavily, &quot;and this one?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Well. I was hustled into a taxi-cab and carried
in a drugged condition to some place where I met with a collection of
scoundrels. A kind of murder-gang, you might call it, who slay, blackmail, and
thieve for the sake of power.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Rather a strange reason,&quot; said Mrs. Jarsell,
equably, and not at all moved, &quot;I should say the reason was for money.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;That,
with power,&quot; explained Dan, &quot;but, indeed, this society appears to be governed on
wonderful principles, such as one would ascribe to honest men.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;In what way?&quot;
Mrs. Jarsell was quite curious in a detached manner. &quot;Well, the members are
chaste and sober and industrious.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;They must be virtuous. You are describing a
society of saints.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Quite so; only these saints apply their virtues to crime.
They have a head who is called Queen Beelzebub.&quot; Mrs. Jarsell shuddered and drew
lines on the dust of the road with her cane slowly and carefully. &quot;Did you see
her?&quot; she asked, &quot;it's a horrid name, full of horrid possibilities.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;No, I did
not see her or anyone,&quot; said Dan, frankly, &quot;the room was in darkness save for a
red light around Queen Beelzebub's mask.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Oh, this person wore a mask! How did
you know she was a woman?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Well, you see, the name is Queen Beelzebub.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;That
might be taken by a man to hide the truth.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;It might,&quot; admitted the other
carelessly, &quot;and, indeed, I don't think that any woman would have the nerve to
belong to such a gang.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I agree with you,&quot; said Mrs. Jarsell, gravely, &quot;well,
and what happened?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I was asked by Queen Beelzebub to join the gang and share
the profits, which you may guess are large. I have a month to think over the
matter.&quot; Mrs. Jarsell looked at him keenly. &quot;Surely, you would never belong to
such an organization,&quot; she said with a reproachful tone in her heavy voice. &quot;Oh,
I don't know. I have my own axe to grind like other people, and, if this gang
helps me to grind it, I may consider the offer. Do I shock you, Mrs. Jarsell?
Your voice sounded as though I did.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;You shock me more than I can say,&quot; she
replied, decisively, &quot;that an honest man should even think of such a thing is
dreadful. This gang should be denounced to the police. I wonder you have not
done so already.&quot; Dan shook his head and admired the cool, clever way in which
she was playing a very dangerous game, though, to be sure, she was far from
suspecting he guessed her connection with Queen Beelzebub. &quot;I can't do that
yet.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;What do you mean by--yet?&quot; questioned Mrs. Jarsell, and this time there
was a distinct note of alarm in her voice. &quot;I risk death if I denounce the gang,
not only to myself, but to Miss Moon. I am sure she and I would be killed as her
father was killed, if I moved in the matter. Also, I am not sure of many
things.&quot; Mrs. Jarsell, still drawing patterns, spoke thoughtfully. &quot;I don't
think you are wise to speak of this gang if it is so dangerous, even to a
country mouse such as I am. Of course, I shall say nothing, as I have no one to
say anything to, and if I had I should not speak. But if you talk to a stranger
like me about things you were told to keep secret, you or Miss Moon may be
murdered.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I thought so a week ago,&quot; admitted Halliday, candidly. &quot;Then you
don't think so now.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;No. Not since Marcus Penn died.&quot; Mrs. Jarsell drew a long
breath and wriggled uneasily. &quot;Who is Marcus Penn?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Well, he was the secretary
of Sir Charles Moon, and afterwards he was the secretary of Lord Curberry. Now
he's a corpse.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Oh,&quot; cried Mrs. Jarsell, suddenly, &quot;I wish you wouldn't talk of
these horrible things. Has this gang----&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Murdered him?&quot; finished the young
man, &quot;yes, I believe so, although a verdict of suicide was brought in. But poor
Penn's death may be the means of saving me and Miss Moon.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Indeed!&quot; the woman's
tone became harsh and imperative, but she did not ask any questions. &quot;Yes. He
left a confession.&quot; Even the side-glance Dan sent in Mrs. Jarsell's direction
showed him that her olive cheeks had turned to a dead white. However, she said
nothing, although she moistened her lips slowly; so he went on easily, as if he
were telling an idle story. &quot;This confession was concealed in Lord Curberry's
house, but Penn sent a note of its whereabouts to Miss Moon, who told me. I got
the confession and placed it in safe keeping.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;That was wise,&quot; said Mrs.
Jarsell, with an effort. &quot;And the safe keeping?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Oh, I shall only tell the
whereabouts of the confession and the name of the person who holds it when there
is no necessity for the confession to be used.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I don't see quite what you
mean, Mr. Halliday.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Well, you see, Mrs. Jarsell, I have to protect myself and
Miss Moon from the machinations of the society. The person who holds the
confession will not open the sealed envelope in which it is placed unless
something happens to Miss Moon or to myself. Therefore, so long as no member of
the gang hurts us, the secrets of the gang are quite safe.&quot; To his attentive ear
it seemed that Mrs. Jarsell drew a long breath of relief. With a command of
herself which did her credit, she displayed no emotion, but observed playfully,
&quot;It is very clever of you and very wise to guard yourself in this way. Certainly
the gang cannot hurt you in any way so long as there is danger of the confession
being opened in the event of things happening to you or to Miss Moon. Suppose
the confession is a very dreadful one, Mr. Halliday?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;It is not so dreadful or
so full as I should like it to be,&quot; said Dan, in his calmest manner, &quot;but there
is sufficient set down to warrant the interference of the authorities. If that
confession comes into the hands of the Scotland Yard officials, they can lay
hands on the gang;&quot; he was bluffing when he said this, as he was not quite sure
if Curberry had not let Mrs. Jarsell know that the confession--as Curberry
thought--had been destroyed. &quot;I think the police should know,&quot; said Mrs.
Jarsell, rising. &quot;Thank you for nothing,&quot; said Dan, following her example, &quot;but,
if I move in the matter, I run the risk of death. Besides, I may accept the
offer of the society. Who knows?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Don't do that,&quot; implored Mrs. Jarsell, so
earnestly that Dan was convinced Curberry had not told her of any confession,
&quot;it's so wicked.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Perhaps it is. However, if the society leave me and Miss Moon
alone, the confession won't be opened and the gang is safe. Otherwise----&quot;
&quot;Otherwise the whole association will be exposed to the danger of arrest,&quot; said
Mrs. Jarsell, lightly, &quot;well, it sounds all very dreadful to a country lady as I
am. I wish you had not told me. Why did you tell me?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Because,&quot; said Dan,
ironically, &quot;I look upon you as a friend.&quot; Mrs. Jarsell's face cleared and she
smiled. &quot;I am your friend,&quot; she said in an emphatic way, &quot;and, believe me when I
say that I am sure Miss Moon is safe.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Thank you,&quot; replied Dan, agreeably, &quot;I
am sure also.&quot; Then they parted with mutual compliments, smiles and handshakes.</p>

<br>
<h4>CHAPTER XVII</h4>
<h5><a name="div1_17" href="#div1Ref_17">AT BAY</a></h5>
<br>

<p>When Dan left Mrs. Jarsell he was very well pleased with the
promise she had given concerning the safety of Lillian. He fully believed that
she, in her role of Queen Beelzebub, would keep that promise faithfully, if only
because her own interests demanded such honesty. The fact that the confession of
Penn was in the hands of a third party, to be made use of should anything happen
to Miss Moon, prevented the Society of Flies from carrying out the threat made
to him at the secret meeting. To save their own lives, the members would be
forced--much against their will no doubt--to spare those of Lillian and himself.
Dan chuckled at the way in which he had circumvented the deadly organization.
But he had only scotched the snake; he had not killed it, and, until he did so,
there was always that chance that it would strike when able to do so with
safety. But, while Penn's confession remained in Laurance's hands, all was well.
One thing struck Halliday as strange, and that was the persistence with which
Mrs. Jarsell kept up the comedy of having-nothing-to-do-with-the-matter during
so confidential a conversation. She knew that Penn had been a doubtful member of
her gang; she knew that he had been despatched--as Dan truly believed--because
he was not to be trusted, and now she knew that he had left a confession behind
him, which was in the hands of her enemies. Also, she was aware that the man who
spoke to her had read the confession and must have guessed that her name, as
Queen Beelzebub, was mentioned therein. This being the case, it is to be
presumed that she would speak freely, but, in place of doing so, she had
pretended ignorance, and for his own ends he had humored her feigning. Either
she doubted that such a confession existed, or she guessed in whose possession
it was, and intended to regain it. &quot;Queen Beelzebub knows well enough that
Freddy is my best friend,&quot; thought Dan, as he returned to the Peacock Hotel,
&quot;and it would be reasonable for her to believe that he had Penn's confession,
which is certainly the case. I should not be at all surprised if Freddy was
inveigled into a trap as I was, so that he might be forced to surrender the
document or rather what remains of it. If that were managed, Queen Beelzebub
would revenge herself on Lillian and on me, since there would be nothing left to
shield us from her spite. And, in any case, Freddy is in danger, as I am certain
she guesses that he holds the confession,&quot; he mused for a few moments, and then
added, aloud, &quot;I shall return to town at once and see him.&quot; The more he thought
the more he saw the necessity of doing this. Mrs. Jarsell's first move to
counterplot him would be to seek out Lord Curberry and learn what she could,
relative to what Penn had left behind him. Certainly Curberry would assure her
that he had burnt the confession, in which case Queen Beelzebub would think that
she would be free to act. But Halliday believed she was of too suspicious a
nature to be quite convinced that he had only bluffed. Before taking any steps,
she would decidedly ascertain for certain--although in what way it was difficult
to say--if there really was any compromising document in Laurance's hands. To do
so, she would, as Dan had thought a few minutes before, set a trap for him, and
browbeat him into stating what he knew and what he held. Therefore, for Freddy's
sake, it was necessary to go to London, and report in detail the conversation on
the moor. Then the two could arrange what was best to be done. They were dealing
with a coterie of daring scoundrels, who would stop at nothing to secure their
own safety, and it behoved them to move warily. &quot;We are walking on a volcano,&quot;
was Halliday's concluding reflection. Of course, as it was useless to alarm the
ladies, Dan said nothing of his meeting with Queen Beelzebub on the moor.
However, on being questioned, he confessed the sudden thought which had sent him
out of doors, and both Lillian and Mrs. Bolstreath agreed that it was entirely
probable that Mrs. Jarsell did travel in up-to-date aeroplanes, like a
mischief-making fairy. Then, in turn, they told him that Mildred had stayed for
quite a long time and was altogether more charming each time she appeared. She
suggested many trips and Mrs. Bolstreath was inclined to stay at Sheepeak longer
than she intended, in spite of the near menace of Queen Beelzebub. Lillian was
delighted with the lovely scenery, so gracious after the drab hues of London. &quot;I
don't see why we shouldn't get a house here after we are married,&quot; she said to
her lover, &quot;one of those delicious old manor houses of faded yellow stone. I
could live quietly with Mrs. Bolstreath, while you ran up to business on your
aeroplane.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;And all the time you would be fretting lest any harm came to him,&quot;
said the chaperon, shaking her head, &quot;besides, my dear, when you are married,
you won't want me to be with you.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Dear Bolly, I shall always want you, and so
will Dan.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Nonsense,&quot; said Mrs. Bolstreath, briskly, &quot;two's company and three's
none.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Well,&quot; remarked Halliday, leisurely, &quot;we can settle the matter when we
are married, Lillian. Remember, before your uncle will consent, I shall have to
discover who murdered your father.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;You have discovered who murdered him. It
was the false Mrs. Brown, who is Mrs. Jarsell, who is Queen Beelzebub.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;So I
believe, but I have to prove my case,&quot; said Dan, dryly, &quot;and, moreover, I won't
find it easy to place the woman in the dock when she has this accursed society
at the back of her.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;You don't think there is danger?&quot; asked Lillian, hastily.
&quot;No, no, no! Things are safer than ever, my dear. I go to town this evening, and
can leave you here with the certainty that all is well.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;You go to town this
evening?&quot; said Mrs. Bolstreath, anxiously, &quot;isn't that a very sudden
resolution?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Oh, I think not,&quot; answered Dan, in an easy way. &quot;I came down here
only to settle you and Lillian. By the way, Sir John----&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I wired our address,
and he wrote me,&quot; interrupted Mrs. Bolstreath, &quot;he is quite pleased that we are
away. I rather think,&quot; the lady added, thoughtfully, &quot;that Sir John is not
ill-pleased we are away. At his age the constant presence of two women in his
house is rather disconcerting. Finding we had left town he returned there to
enjoy his own house to himself.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;In that case,&quot; said Dan, cheerfully, &quot;he will
be glad to see Lillian married.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;But to Lord Curberry, not to you.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I would
die rather than marry Lord Curberry,&quot; said Lillian, decisively, and with her
chin in the air. &quot;You won't be asked to do either one or the other, my dear,&quot;
replied Dan, in his calmest tone. &quot;We shall marry, right enough, whatever
opposition Sir John may make. As to Lord Curberry,&quot; he hesitated. &quot;Well?&quot; asked
Mrs. Bolstreath, impatiently. &quot;I intend to see him when I return to town.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I
think it will be as well. Better have a complete understanding with him so that
he will not worry Lillian any more.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;He won't,&quot; answered Dan, grimly, &quot;and now
I shall have to get away. I see Mrs. Pelgrin has had the trap brought round.
Take care of Lillian.&quot; Lillian kissed her lover and followed him to the door of
the sitting-room with a gay laugh. &quot;Lillian can look after herself,&quot; she said
lightly, &quot;I am not afraid of Mrs. Jarsell or of anyone else. But you take care,
Dan. I fear much more for you than for myself.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I'm all right!&quot; Dan, with an
Englishman's dislike for an emotional scene, kissed the girl again and slipped
out of the door. They saw him drive away in the gloom of the evening, and then
settled to make themselves comfortable. Neither Lillian nor Mrs. Bolstreath
would admit as much, but both felt rather downcast at Dan's sudden departure.
Luckily, as he had been so cool and composed, they did not connect it with any
fresh development likely to give trouble. In some vague way Mrs. Bolstreath
guessed that Dan had spiked the guns of the enemy under which they were
encamped, and, her certainty of safety, being infectious, Lillian also felt
quite at her ease. Meanwhile, Dan reached the Beswick station in the ramshackle
trap and was lucky enough to catch the in-going train to Thawley, just as it
started to glide past the platform. The fortunate connection enabled him to
board the seven-twenty express to London, where he hoped to arrive shortly
before eleven that same evening. Knowing that Laurance's work kept him up late
at night, he wired from Thawley, asking him to come to St. Pancras Station.
Important as was Freddy's time, Dan knew that he would respond to the call at
once, knowing that large issues would be the outcome of the present situation.
Therefore, as the train dropped south, Halliday felt quite comfortable, as he
had done all he could to arrange matters for the moment. Indeed, so assured did
he feel that he had taken all possible precautions, that he did not even trouble
to think over the matter, but fell asleep and refreshed his weary brain and
body. Only when the train arrived at St. Pancras did he tumble out, sleepy
still, to catch a sight of his faithful friend on the platform. &quot;Nothing wrong?&quot;
asked Laurance, hurrying up. &quot;Nothing wrong,&quot; responded Dan, with a yawn, &quot;but I
have much to talk to you about. Get a four-wheeler.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;A taxi you mean.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I don't
mean. I wish to travel as slowly as possible, so as to explain matters. Tell the
man to drive to <i>The Moment</i> office. There I can drop you and go on to my
rooms.&quot; Thus understanding the situation, Freddy selected a shaky old cab, drawn
by a shaky old horse, and the rate at which it progressed through the
brilliantly lighted streets was so slow that they were a very long time arriving
at <i>The Moment</i> office in Fleet Street. In the damp-smelling interior of this
antique conveyance, Halliday, now quite alert and clearheaded, gave his friend a
full account of all that had happened, particularly emphasizing the interview
with Mrs. Jarsell. &quot;H'm,&quot; commenced Freddy, when he ended, &quot;so she didn't give
herself away?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;No; and very wisely, too, I think. She didn't know how much I
knew, and wasn't keen on giving me rope to hang her.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;But she knows you have
read Penn's confession--what there is of it.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I didn't tell her that I had
anything else than the full confession, old son. She may think I have the whole
document intact, or--and this I fancy is probable--she may believe that there
isn't any confession in existence.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Curberry may have written to her, telling
her that he burnt the confession.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;No,&quot; said Dan, after a pause, &quot;I really
don't think he has done that. Mrs. Jarsell went dead white when I mentioned a
confession.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Then she believes that you spoke the truth,&quot; persisted Laurance,
hopefully. &quot;She may, or she may not, as I said before,&quot; retorted Halliday,
&quot;anyhow, as she can't be sure if I'm in jest or earnest, she will delay
proceedings until she sees Curberry. If he swears that he burnt the confession,
Mrs. Jarsell may act; therefore I want you to send him an unsigned telegram,
containing these three words, 'All is discovered!'&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;What will that do?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Put
the fear of God into Curberry, into Queen Beelzebub, and into the Society of
Flies as a whole. The warning will be so vague that they won't know who will
strike the blow.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;They will suspect you, Dan.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;In that case,&quot; replied
Halliday, promptly, &quot;Queen Beelzebub will leave Lillian alone, and my object
will be obtained. I want to gain time, and can only do so with safety to Lillian
by keeping these beasts in a state of uncertainty as to how much or how little
is known.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I see,&quot; Laurance thought the plan a good one, &quot;since you say that
you have the confession and Curberry will say that he destroyed it, Queen
Beelzebub will be undecided. This telegram, like a bolt from the blue, will
clinch matters and make her and her gang pause before they take steps to hurt
you or Miss Moon. I'll send the wire. What then?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Then--to-morrow that is--I go
down to see Curberry, and have it out with him. His name is mentioned in the
portion of the confession which you hold and we know enough to ensure his
arrest.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;That is doubtful,&quot; protested Freddy, thoughtfully, &quot;I have read the
confession. Penn hints a lot about Curberry, but doesn't say enough to----&quot;
&quot;Never mind, he says enough for my purpose, which is to scare Curberry;
belonging to the Society of Flies, as he does. I believe he got his uncle and
cousin put out of the way to inherit the title and property. I'll harp on that
string. If Queen Beelzebub calls----&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;There's the danger, Dan,&quot; interposed
Freddy, quickly and anxiously. &quot;I know. I am far from suggesting that there is
not danger, as we are driving these people into a corner. If I don't turn up at
your office by five o'clock to-morrow, Freddy, or if I don't send a wire saying
that I am safe, you get Inspector Tenson, tell him all, show him the confession,
and come down with him to Blackheath to see the Inspector who had charge of the
Durwin murder. Then, armed with the authority of the law, you can go to
Curberry's house. If I am missing, you will know how to act.&quot; Laurance drew a
deep breath as the cab turned into Fleet Street. &quot;It's a big risk for you, Dan.&quot;
&quot;Pooh. As an aviator I am always taking risks. I must settle this business
somehow, if I wish to marry Lillian and save her life as well as my own from
these infernal beasts. Here you get down, Freddy. Don't forget to do as I tell
you,&quot; and Laurance promised to faithfully adhere to his instructions, while the
four-wheeler lumbered away in the direction of the Strand. Halliday possessed
one of those rare natures which invariably reveal their best in time of danger.
He knew what to say and how to act when in a tight corner, and his training as
an aviator had learned him to take risks from which less level-headed men would
have shrunk. At the present moment he required all his energies to cope with
unforeseen emergencies, since he did not quite know what action would be taken
against him. Of course, he was confident that some sort of action would be
taken, since he had aroused the wrath of a brilliantly clever and intensely evil
set of people. Fearful for their own safety, the Society of Flies would do its
best to get rid of him and to get rid of Lillian, as they had gotten rid of
others who had stood in their crooked path. Both he and the girl were
safeguarded so far by the confession, but it all depended upon what Curberry
said to Queen Beelzebub as to how long such a safeguard would be efficacious. He
had told the woman one story, but Curberry would tell her another, so it was
doubtful which she would believe. The telegram from an unknown source might turn
the balance in his favor, and lead both Mrs. Jarsell and her friend to believe
that there was a chance of their devilish doings coming to light. Having arrived
at this conclusion, Dan fell asleep, quite indifferent to the fact that the
sword of Damocles hung over his head, and that the single hair might part at any
moment. Herein he showed the steadiness of his nerves, and the value of a nature
trained to face the worst smilingly. Next morning Halliday arose brisk and
cheerful with the expectation of having a most exciting day, and as soon as he
finished his breakfast made his way, by train, to Blackheath. On arriving there,
somewhere about twelve o'clock, he did not go immediately to Curberry's house,
but walked to the place where the Vincent aeroplane was housed. It had just
struck him that Mrs. Jarsell might have wired to one of her friends to damage
the machine, so that it could not be used. She had procured it for him and
he--to put it plainly--had abused her friendship, so it was not likely she would
permit him to retain, unharmed, a wonderful airship, with which he could make
money and win fame. But, when he reached the shed and saw the man whom he had
engaged to watch the machine, he found that his fears were groundless. No one
had been near the place, and, so far as he could ascertain, the aeroplane was in
perfect condition. Then it struck Dan, as it was yet too early to call on Lord
Curberry, that he might indulge in a little fly. His enemy's house was only a
stone's throw distant, on the borders of the open space, and Halliday did not
intend to lose sight of the entrance gate, lest Mrs. Jarsell should steal in
unobserved. In the air, and hovering directly over the grounds, he could see all
who came and went. Also, incidentally, he might gain information as to what was
going on in the gardens. Somewhat oddly, it occurred to him that if Queen
Beelzebub came, she might push Curberry into the ornamental pond, as Marcus Penn
had been pushed. There was no knowing what she might do in her despair. In
brutal English, Queen Beelzebub was at bay, and could fight, like the rat she
was, in the corner into which she was being slowly driven by circumstances,
engineered by Mr. Daniel Halliday. Therefore, Dan saw to the fittings of the
biplane, and ascertained by sight and touch that they had not been tampered
with. He oiled the engine, saw that it did not lack petroleum, and, in fact, was
as careful of all and everything connected with the structure as though he was
preparing for a long race. Of course there was the usual crowd of loafers who
came to see him start, and he swept upward from the ground in a graceful curve.
The aeroplane acted easily and truthfully, according to its very excellent
design, and the aviator, after making a wide circle, dropped down, to pass
slowly over the grounds of Curberry's mansion. He could see no one about, even
though the day was fine and sunny, so concluded that the owner, having received
the anonymous telegram, was shivering within doors, terrified to venture out. In
his impatience to learn the absolute truth, Dan turned his machine back to the
shed, and came to rest almost at the very door. Owing to the examination of the
aeroplane, and the experimental flight to test its working order, time had
passed uncommonly swiftly, and it was now fifteen minutes past one o'clock. Dan
made up his mind to beard Curberry in his library, without waiting for the
arrival of Queen Beelzebub, who, after all, might not arrive. His man and some
willing onlookers wheeled the machine into the great shed, and the doors were
about to be closed when one of the crowd uttered an exclamation, which was
echoed by many others. Halliday, always on the alert for the unexpected, came
quickly to the door of the building, and saw everyone looking upward and
northward, to where a small black dot spotted the blue of the sky. It increased
in size rapidly, and there was no difficulty in seeing that it was a
flying-machine. At once a thought entered Dan's mind that there was Mrs. Jarsell
on a Vincent biplane, paying her expected visit, although he had no reason to
suppose that she was the pilot. Wondering if he was right or wrong in his
surmise, he waited with a fast-beating heart, and became certain of the truth of
his guess very shortly. Travelling at a great height, the strange biplane poised
itself directly over the open space, and then began to drop slowly into the
enclosed grounds of Lord Curberry's mansion. Not having field-glasses, Halliday
could not make out if the pilot was a man or a woman, but, when the machine,
cleverly managed, disappeared below the trees and walls of the park, he was
convinced that Queen Beelzebub had arrived. At once he determined to make a
third at her interview with Curberry, whatever objections might be raised. But
first he arranged what to do in order to guard against future events of a
dangerous nature. &quot;Wheel my machine out again,&quot; he ordered the man and those who
had assisted, &quot;see that everything is in order, and have everything prepared to
start. Do not let anyone touch this,&quot; and he tapped the aeroplane, &quot;you
understand?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yes, sir,&quot; said the man stolidly, &quot;you're going for another fly?&quot;
&quot;Exactly. The person who arrived is a friend of mine. I am going into yonder
house to ask if a race can be arranged.&quot; Knowing that he could trust his man to
guard the machine, and certain it would not be tampered with when hundreds of
eyes were watching it, Halliday walked across the open space with serene
confidence. It struck him that if Mrs. Jarsell wished to escape, she would
certainly use her biplane, and it was just as well to follow in his own and run
her to earth. As both machines were made by Vincent, the speed of each would be
about equal, and, in any case, Dan hoped to keep Queen Beelzebub in sight, if it
was necessary to give chase. Having thus prepared for possible emergencies, the
young man entered the big gates of the park and hastened up the short avenue.
Soon he found himself at the front door, and, as he rang the bell, glanced
around for Mrs. Jarsell's flying-machine. It was not visible, so he presumed she
had left it on the broad and spacious lawn on the further side of the house. It
was in his mind to go and tamper with the engine to prevent her further flight,
but, before he could make up his mind to this course, the door opened and the
footman appeared. &quot;I wish to see Lord Curberry,&quot; said Halliday, giving the man
his card, &quot;on most important business. Can he see me?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I'll inquire, sir. He is
with a lady just now, and has been for the last ten minutes. Please wait here,
sir,&quot; and he introduced Dan into the hall. Again, when left alone, Halliday had
the impulse to go out and look to the gear of the machine, with the idea of
putting things wrong, and again the footman appeared before he could decide if
it would be wise to do so. &quot;His lordship will see you, sir,&quot; said the man, who
looked rather uncomfortable, &quot;but he seems to be ill.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Ill,&quot; echoed Dan,
wondering what new deviltry was taking place, &quot;and the lady?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;She is not with
his lordship now, sir,&quot; said the footman, in a bewildered manner, &quot;yet I showed
her into the library a few minutes ago.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Do you know the lady?&quot; asked Halliday,
sharply. &quot;No, sir. At least, I can't tell, sir. She came in one of them
flying-machines, and wears a thick veil. She's a stout lady, sir, with a sharp
manner.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Take me to your master,&quot; commanded Dan, not caring to ask further
questions, since it was best to ask them of Lord Curberry himself, and the man
obeyed, still bewildered and nervous in his manner. The entrance of Queen
Beelzebub into the house had evidently upset things. Ushered into the library,
Dan waited for the closing of the door, and then advanced to where Curberry was
seated at his desk, near the window. The man looked gaunt and haggard, and very
sick. When the young man advanced, he rose as if moved by springs, and held out
a telegram in a trembling hand. &quot;You--you--sent this,&quot; quavered Curberry, and
Halliday could see that the perspiration beaded his bald high forehead. In a
flash Halliday guessed that this was the wire which Laurance had dispatched
according to arrangement. &quot;No, I did not send you any telegram,&quot; he denied,
calmly, and with perfect truth. &quot;You sent this, saying that all is discovered,&quot;
stuttered Curberry again, and dropped back into his seat, &quot;you have learned too
much. She says that you know everything.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Queen Beelzebub?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Ah, you know the
name. I guessed as much. She is here; she is furious!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Who is Queen Beelzebub?&quot;
demanded Dan, anxiously. &quot;You know. Why do you ask questions you know the answer
to? I know why you have come; to have me arrested. I thought I destroyed the
confession of that infernal Penn. But she says----&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I retained sufficient to
show me----&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yes, yes! You know all. You have won. I fought you for Lillian,
and there is no chance of my gaining her for my wife. You won't either. You have
to reckon with Queen Beelzebub. As for me--as for me----&quot; he faltered, and
trembled. Dan stepped right up to the desk. &quot;What's the matter?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I--I--I have
taken poison,&quot; gasped Curberry, and dropped his head on his hands with a sob.</p>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<h4>CHAPTER XVIII</h4>
<h5><a name="div1_18" href="#div1Ref_18">THE FLIGHT</a></h5>
<br>

<p>&quot;Poison!&quot; echoed Dan, startled out of his composure,
for he was far from expecting such a word, &quot;the doctor----&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;No doctor can do me
any good,&quot; sobbed Curberry, lifting his haggard face, and looking up with wild,
despairing eyes, &quot;there is no antidote to this drug I have taken. It is
painless, more or less, and in an hour I shall be dead, as it works but slowly.
Time enough for me to speak.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Let me get a doctor,&quot; insisted Halliday, for so
distraught did the man look that he was not surprised that the servant had been
uncomfortable, &quot;you must not die without----&quot; Curberry struggled to his feet,
and laid hands on his visitor. &quot;No, no! I am ready to die,&quot; he said in a harsh,
strained voice, &quot;why should I be kept alive to be hanged--to be disgraced--to
be----&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Then you admit----&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I admit everything in this--this,&quot; he touched a
few loose sheets of paper lying on the desk, &quot;this confession. Like Penn, I have
made one.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;You must have a doctor,&quot; said Halliday, and ran to the bell.
Curberry, with a wonderful strength, seeing how ill he looked, rose swiftly, and
sprang after him. &quot;If you call a doctor I shall shoot myself,&quot; he said,
hoarsely, and pulled out a small revolver. &quot;I would rather die by means of the
poison I have taken, since it is more painless. But, sooner than be taken by the
police, I shall shoot myself--and you, too--and you, too.&quot; Halliday waived aside
this threat. &quot;You won't see the police----&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;The doctor would try to save me,&quot;
insisted Curberry, fiercely, &quot;and I will not be saved only to be hanged. Stay
here and listen to me. I have something to say. Touch the button of the bell and
I shoot!&quot; As he spoke he levelled the revolver. &quot;Quick, quick, what will you
do?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Have your own way,&quot; agreed Halliday, and moved to the desk, where he sat
down on a convenient chair. Curberry, with a groan, returned to his seat, and
laid the revolver on the blotting paper, ready for instant use should necessity
arise. Even as yet he did not wholly trust Halliday. And there was cause for his
suspicion. Since Dan was unarmed, he could do nothing against a man with a
quick-firing weapon, but he made up his mind to snatch at the revolver the
moment Curberry was off his guard. Yet, even as he decided upon this course, he
said to himself that it was foolish. The man's recovery, supposing a doctor did
arrive, meant the man's arrest, and, in Dan's opinion, as in Curberry's, death
was better than disgrace. It was a most uncomfortable situation, but Halliday
did not see anything to do but to listen to what his host had to say. The poor
wretch had poisoned himself, and was keeping all help at bay with his revolver.
He would be dead in an hour, or half an hour, as he hinted, so the best thing
was to hear his story in the hope that by its means those who had brought him to
this pass could be punished. But it was a weird experience to sit beside a
tormented man, who declined to be saved from a tragic death. &quot;Did Queen
Beelzebub give you the poison?&quot; asked Halliday, shivering at the gray pinched
look on Curberry's face. &quot;Long ago; long ago; not now,&quot; muttered the man,
groaning. &quot;Every member of the Society of Flies has this poison to escape
arrest, should there be danger. It is a painless poison, more or less, and acts
slowly, and--but I have told you all this before. There is not much time,&quot; he
pressed his hands on his heart, &quot;while I retain my strength and my senses,
listen!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;But where is this woman you call Queen Beelzebub,&quot; demanded Dan,
looking round anxiously. &quot;I saw her arrive in an aeroplane.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;She did; she came
to tell me that you knew all about our society.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;You belong to it?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yes, curse
it, and those who dragged me into the matter. I was getting on all right in the
law, when I was tempted and fell.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Your uncle and your cousin----&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yes, yes!&quot;
broke in Curberry, with another groan, &quot;she said that if I joined the society,
they could be got rid of. They were got rid of because I wished for the title
and the money.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;But for what reason?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;So that I could marry Lillian. Moon
refused to listen to me so long as I was merely a struggling barrister. But,
when I became wealthy and--and--oh, this pain. The poison is a lie like all the
rest of the business.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;She declared it was painless, and now--and now----&quot; he
broke off, to wipe the perspiration from his face. Dan half rose. &quot;Let me call
assistance. It may not be too late----&quot; Curberry pointed his revolver at him as
he moved. &quot;It <i>is</i> too late,&quot; he said, setting his teeth, &quot;if I do not die, I
must face the worst. You--you have brought me to this.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I!&quot; echoed Halliday,
sitting down again, &quot;in what way?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;You meddled and meddled, and--and you sent
that telegram.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I did not.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Then your meddling has brought the police into the
matter. That telegram may have been sent by a friend or an enemy; in either case
it is true, for all is discovered. I was----&quot; Curberry gasped with pain again,
and moistened his dry lips. &quot;I was sitting with it, wondering if it was best to
end things or to wait and see if the warning was a true one. Then she came in
through yonder door,&quot; he nodded towards the entrance from the terrace into the
library. &quot;She told me that you--that you--oh--oh!&quot; he groaned, and rocked
himself from side to side, yet kept a grip on the revolver, lest Dan should call
or ring for assistance, or endeavor to secure the weapon. &quot;So you took the
poison?&quot; said Halliday, wondering how he could manage to evade being shot and
summon a doctor. &quot;When she said that all was known, I did. Then she--she----&quot;
&quot;Queen Beelzebub you mean?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Curse her, yes. Like Eve, she tempted me, and, like
Adam, I fell.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Where is she?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Up in Penn's old rooms, searching for any
further confession he may have left. Oh,&quot; Curberry rocked and moaned, &quot;I thought
when I snatched it from you, and burnt it, that all evidence was destroyed.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I
saved a few sheets.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Do they contain mention of my name?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yes; they do,
and----&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I thought so. I thought so. It's just as well that I took poison. The
title and money I paid such a price to obtain will go to my cousin, who is at
Oxford--a young fool with no brains. Oh, to lose all when everything was so
bright. I could have married Lillian and served my country, and----&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;You could
not have married Lillian,&quot; interrupted Dan, positively, &quot;for she loves me and me
only. As to serving your country, how could you, with an easy conscience, when
you have broken its law by taking the lives of your uncle and cousin?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I did
not. The society saw to that,&quot; gasped Curberry with a twisted grin. &quot;You engaged
the society to end their lives, you--you--murderer.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Don't call names,&quot; moaned
the man, &quot;at least I have not murdered you, although I have every reason to. You
meddled with matters which do not concern you.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I meddled in matters which
concern every honest man who loves law and order, Lord Curberry,&quot; said Dan,
sternly, &quot;apart from the death of Sir Charles Moon, which I was bound to avenge
for Lillian's sake, it was my duty to stop this wholesale murder. Perhaps you
had Moon killed yourself.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I didn't; I didn't. It was to my interest that he
should live, for if he had I should have been married to his daughter by this
time. Queen Beelzebub murdered him because he was offered a chance of belonging
to the society and refused.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;In that,&quot; said Dan, sternly, &quot;acting as an honest
man.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;He acted as a foolish man. For, learning too much, he sent for Durwin to
reveal what he knew. Penn found out his intended treachery, and told the Queen.
She came--you saw her when she came--and she killed him.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;She killed Durwin?&quot;
&quot;Yes,&quot; gasped Curberry, who was growing whiter and more haggard every moment.
&quot;And Marcus Penn?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I killed him. I had to, or be killed myself. He betrayed too
much to you.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Only out of fear,&quot; said Dan, looking at the murderer more with
pity than with anger, for he was suffering greatly. &quot;Not even fear should have
made him reveal anything about the scent. He confessed his folly and was doomed
to death. I went away on that day, and then came back secretly, having ordered
Penn to meet me by the ornamental water, to speak about the society. He
suspected something, because he wrote that confession and let Lillian know where
it was concealed. But he came, and I managed to stupefy him with the Sumatra
scent, after which I thrust him under water, and, when I was sure he was dead, I
got away secretly, returning openly to hear that his body had been found.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;You
wicked wretch,&quot; said Dan, scarcely able to restrain his disgust, although he
felt he should not be too hard on one already being severely punished for his
crimes. &quot;Don't call names,&quot; said Curberry, with an attempt at a laugh, &quot;after
all, I am better than you think, since I am trying to save you. I want you to
live and marry Lillian, and keep this confession,&quot; he laid his hands on the
loose sheets of paper &quot;from Queen Beelzebub, so that you can put an end to her
wicked doings. Hide the papers when she comes back, or she will destroy them.&quot;
As this was very probable, Dan stretched out his hand for the papers. Curberry
feverishly gathered them together, speaking in a halting manner, as he did so.
&quot;Wait till I put them together,&quot; he said, painfully, &quot;this is a full account of
my connection with the society and its evil doings. It accounts for the death of
Moon, of Durwin, of Penn, and of myself. But, take care, Halliday, for Queen
Beelzebub will not give in without a fight.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;She can do nothing,&quot; said Dan,
watching Curberry pinning the loose papers together. &quot;Laurance has what remains
of Penn's confession, and will inform the police shortly. If you would let me
get a doctor.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;No, no, no! I refuse to live and face the reward of my
wickedness. I prefer to pay the cost of my folly in joining the society. My name
is disgraced, but I won't be on earth to suffer for the disgrace. That brainless
young fool who succeeds me will not trouble you so long as he gets the money and
the title, which he is certain to. But marry Lillian, and take care of her.
Queen Beelzebub will strike at you through her.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;She dare not while I hold the
confession of Penn,&quot; said Dan, grimly, &quot;sooner or later she shall stand in the
dock.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;That she never will, believe me. She has a means of escape if the worst
comes to the worst. Oh,&quot; Curberry half rose, and then fell back in his chair,
&quot;the end is coming; my eyes are growing dim, and--and--ah,&quot; he uttered a shriek,
&quot;save yourself!&quot; and, with a shaking hand, he grasped the revolver. As
Curberry's eyes were looking past him, Dan, with the subconscious instinct of
self-preservation, had just time to rise and swerve to one side, when a hand
grazed his shoulder. The young man gripped his chair, and swung it up as a
barrier between himself and a stout woman, who was immediately behind him. She
was dressed in a long, black cloak, with a close-fitting cloth cap, and wore a
heavy veil of the motor style, with pieces of mica let in as eyeholes. Not a
word did she say, but, seeing Dan's action, drew back with a deep, indrawn
breath like the hiss of a baffled snake. &quot;Take care; take care; she has--the
serpent poison,&quot; gasped Curberry, who was sitting loosely in his chair, gripping
his revolver. Halliday remembered the wicked wound on Sir Charles Moon's neck,
and his flesh grew cold, for the slightest touch of that morsel of shining steel
in Queen Beelzebub's hand meant swift death. &quot;You fiend!&quot; he shouted, and, with
a cry of anger, flung the heavy chair fairly at her. With the leap of a
pantheress, she sprang to one side, and the chair crashed against the opposite
wall, while the woman glided rapidly round to the open door of the terrace. A
shot rang out as she reached it, and Dan knew that the dying man had fired on
his enemy. Apparently the bullet did not reach its mark, for Queen Beelzebub
still moved on, silent, sinister, and dangerous. Halliday flung himself forward
to get between her and the door, so as to prevent her escape, but with a faint
snarl like a beast at bay she stabbed at him with the death-tip's piece of
steel. He leaped back to save himself from being scratched, while Curberry
dragged himself painfully to the bell-button near the fire-place, and pressed it
with his remaining strength. &quot;I'm done for--call the police. You--you, oh!&quot; He
fell prone on the hearth-rug, and the revolver dropped beside him. Halliday ran
forward on the impulse of the moment to offer aid, hastily picking up the weapon
meanwhile, and as he did so, Queen Beelzebub sprang through the door into the
open. &quot;She's making for the aeroplane,&quot; cried Dan, and would have followed on
the instant, but that Curberry gripped him fast. &quot;Stay, stay! A priest; a
clergyman. I'm dying,&quot; and a deadly fear became apparent in his glazed eyes,
&quot;get a--a--a help!&quot; As he cried, retaining Dan's coat in a grip of iron, the
door of the room opened, and the butler with the footman beside him rushed in.
The shot, as well as the ringing of the bell, had brought them immediately to
the spot. Trying to disengage himself, Dan gave hasty orders. &quot;Send for a
doctor; send for a clergyman; send for the police. That woman has murdered your
master.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Catch her; stop her--oh--oh!&quot; Curberry's grip loosened, and he rolled
over with a moan. Whether he was dead or alive, Dan did not wait to see. Every
moment was precious, if he intended to stay the flight of Queen Beelzebub. The
terrified men came to assist their dying master, and more servants, attracted by
the noise, poured in at the library door. A backward glance showed Dan that
Curberry was being attended to, and then he sped along the terrace towards the
lawn at the side of the house. Here he arrived, just a moment too late, for
already the aeroplane was spinning along the turf, with Queen Beelzebub in the
pilot's seat. Like the wicked fairy of nursery tale, she was escaping in her
dragon-car, and even in that hour of success she did not utter a sound. Silent
and menacing she mounted into the air, and Halliday dashed forward with a cry of
rage as she lifted above his reach. There was not a moment to be lost, and
without another glance, he raced down the avenue, and made for the entrance
gates. Queen Beelzebub might make for her lair in Hillshire, or it might be that
she would cross the Channel to seek safety on the Continent; but, wherever she
went, Dan intended to follow. She would not escape him this time, and he flew
like an arrow from the bow across from the open space outside the park, to where
his man still stood guard by his own machine. The little crowd around had their
faces turned heavenward, and were shouting at the sight of the biplane, now
dwindling to a black dot, as it receded swiftly from Blackheath. Dan felt a
throb of satisfaction as he saw that Queen Beelzebub was making for the north.
&quot;Out of the way; out of the way,&quot; gasped the young man, charging through the
throng, and it scattered at his approach, &quot;let her go, let her go!&quot; and he
sprang into the pilot's seat to start the engine. Immediately the screw began to
spin, slowly at first, but gathering in speed every second. The aeroplane moved,
and ran with bird-like swiftness along the ground, then soared with the hum of a
giant bee. Halliday swept in a vast circle, like an actor taking the stage, then
turned the nose of his machine in the direction of the black dot. This was to be
his pole-star towards which he was to continually direct his course, until the
goal, wherever it might be, was attained. The many men, women and children
standing round the Blackheath shed shouted and cheered, thinking that they were
witnessing the start of an exciting race; but they little knew that it was a
chase dealing with the serious issues of life and death. Halliday heard the thin
sound of their voices reach him faintly, then settled down to handle his biplane
in a masterly manner. Since both aeroplanes were made by Vincent, it was
probable that both were equal in durability and speed. But Queen Beelzebub had
gained a very fair start, and Dan knew that it would require all his knowledge
of aviation to catch her up. Her escape or capture depended entirely upon the
dexterity with which he man&#339;uvered the delicate structure which bore him. On
her part, the woman would use all her knowledge to get away safely, but Dan did
not believe that her capability as an aeronaut was equal to his own. In this
contest it was science against despair, and given the machines as equal, yet the
pilots as unequal, it was hard to say what would be the result. Halliday, racing
to save Lillian's life, and to gain her as his wife, believed that the final
victory would remain with him. It was an unusually pleasant day, with a pale
blue sky, lightly sprinkled with feathery white clouds. A gentle wind was
blowing, which was not sufficiently strong to impede the speed of the
aeroplanes. Yet it was chilly in these high altitudes, and in his haste Dan had
not put on his overcoat. Before the end of the chase he grimly expected to be
well-nigh frozen, but did not mind so uncomfortable a prospect so long as he
gained his aim. Before him fled the woman he was determined to capture and place
in the criminal dock to answer for her manifold sins. Thinking of what she had
done, and how her path was strewn with victims, the young man set his teeth and
tried his best to force the pace. But this was useless, as the biplane could not
do more than it was intended to do. Although he had now been racing northward
for over an hour, the distance between pursuer and pursued appeared to be much
the same, and the receding black dot did not seem to be growing larger. Dan was
irritated, yet felt that even though he was not gaining, he was not losing, and
that was much, taking all things into account. There was always the chance that
Queen Beelzebub's machine might break down, and then she would be as helpless as
a bird with a broken wing. Also--and Dan did not blind himself to this
possibility--his own aeroplane might come to grief, as it had done during the
London to York race. But, benefiting by his former experience, he did not try
any fancy-flying, and held to a straight undeviating course. Both machines were
making a bee-line for the goal, which Halliday now guessed very plainly was The
Grange in Sheepeak, Hillshire. It had been about two o'clock when the chase
started, but already those taking part in it were miles upon miles distant from
London, since the aeroplanes were flying at the rate of between fifty and sixty
miles an hour. Harrow, St. Albans, Luton, Bedford and Northampton had long since
dropped behind, and Queen Beelzebub, swerving to the left, was making for Rugby,
so as to get into the straight line for Hillshire, and particularly for Thawley.
Passing over the famous school-town the pace slackened somewhat, and Dan managed
to secure the advantage of a few miles. But when her machine lifted Birmingham,
she increased her speed, a fact which made Dan curse. He had been under the
impression that she was running short of oil and petroleum, but apparently this
was not the case. She had simply reduced her speed so as to nurse her resources,
since she could take this bold step because of the start she had gained at the
outset. Halliday grudgingly confessed to himself that the woman, knew her
business, as she wasted no time. Her machine neither rose nor fell, nor deviated
to right or left overmuch, and all she did was to hold to a straight line at a
moderate height above the earth, humoring her engine, and straining as little as
might be the wings, spars, bolts, and such-like gear of the biplane. Vincent had
taught her admirably, and Dan no longer undervalued her as an antagonist. She
was dexterous, bold, resourceful, and venturesome. His admiration, now freely
given, was mixed with pity that so clever a human being should debase her gifts
to harry mankind. Such qualities as she possessed made her more dangerous, as
she was an intellectual animal, slaying with taught skill rather than with
instinctive cunning. As the afternoon drew on, and the chase still continued,
the night began to shut down. Gliding over Derby the town was veiled in the gray
mists of swiftly-falling dusk, and when Nottingham came in sight it was
distinguished by a thousand glittering pin-points of light, the usual nightly
illumination. Matlock, and Mansfield, Holdbrook and Wayleigh, gleamed beneath
like jewelled crowns, and when the stars began to appear the aeroplanes were
flying between two firmaments, radiant with multi-colored orbs of light. At last
Thawley rose into view burning like a furnace under its veil of smoke and the
dim shroudings of twilight, while a vague murmur like the swarming of bees came
muffled to the ears of those who drove the machines. Yet at these heights the
coming dark was not yet very intense, and Queen Beelzebub's aeroplane, beginning
to slacken speed, Dan was able to keep it well in view. He saw it rather vaguely
closer at hand, a shadow against the shadow of the gray sky. Minute by minute he
drew nearer and began to discern the outlines more or less clearly. But it must
be admitted that at the best the clearness was not quite that which deserved the
use of such a word. However, Dan, cold, hungry, and weary with the strain on his
nerves, could think of none better at the moment. Queen Beelzebub was decidedly
losing speed. Her machine seemed to falter after it left Thawley, as if it was
doubtful how to find its way home in this world of shadows. But at Beswick the
woman made a last effort, as it seemed, like a wounded animal dragging itself
faster homeward as it neared its den, and her aeroplane towered aloft to the
vast tableland of the moors. Halliday was close behind, and when they hovered
over Sheepeak the two biplanes were only a stone throw from one another. He
exulted, for now he had driven the woman to her citadel, and for her there was
no escape even by her machine, as that was--so to speak--worn out. She was at
her last gasp, and would have to fight or yield. She elected to fight when the
airships swung in the foggy air over the fields near The Grange. If she
alighted, Queen Beelzebub knew that her pursuer would alight also and capture
her, so she described a rapid circle with what motive power was left her, and
plunged downward on her enemy to ram his machine. Dan saw the movement, and with
his hand on the steering gear, swerved to one side, dropping lower as he did so.
The other machine swooped harmlessly overhead, but, recovering quickly, once
more came down with the dip of a hawk on a heron. Halliday dodged again, then
thinking that two could play at the dangerous game, he watched his chance and
rushed straightly at his prey. Queen Beelzebub saw him coming, and adopted his
tactics--that is, she dropped below his onset, and Dan's aeroplane swept on
without result. Once more he came down to her level, and by this time the
machines were only twenty feet from the ground. This time, as he dashed forward,
the woman was not dexterous enough to get out of the way, and the two clashed
violently with a ripping, breaking, smashing sound. With the engines still
spinning, but with broken wings, the biplanes dropped to the earth, tangled
together, Dan's uppermost, clutching at its prey, so to speak, like a hawk
clutching a partridge. Down they came, and the rising earth met them with a
smashing blow. Halliday was shaken, but did not become unconscious. Clearing his
feet and arms from the tangle of ropes and canvas, he emerged from the confused
heap, and dragged out the woman by her dress, which fluttered out from the
wreckage. To tear off her veil and light a match took a single minute. &quot;Miss
Armour!&quot; cried Dan, greatly amazed. And Miss Armour it was, quite senseless.</p>

<h4>CHAPTER XIX</h4>
<h5><a name="div1_19" href="#div1Ref_19">TREACHERY</a></h5>
<br>

<p>In the chill gray gloom of the fields, damp, depressing
and misty, with the wreckage of the airship piled up around him, and the
insensible woman lying at his feet, Dan stood bewildered, his nerves jangling
like ill-tuned bells. The twenty feet fall had not harmed him in limb or body;
but the violent contact with the earth, broken in some measure by the fact that
his enemy's aeroplane had been underneath, resulted in a displacement of his
normal powers. He felt battered and bruised, deadly sick and wished to lie on
the wet grass, indifferent to everything and everyone. But with a dangerous
creature at his elbow, this was not to be thought of, even though that same
creature was unable to exercise her wicked will. Moreover, The Grange was only a
stone's throw distant, and doubtless Mrs. Jarsell had been watching for the
coming of her friend. If this were the case, she would come out with help--for
Queen Beelzebub, that is. How Halliday would be treated he was much too muddled
in his brain to consider. Finally, he dropped on his knees, longing for brandy
to pull him together, and began to think with difficulty. This woman was not
Mrs. Jarsell, but Miss Armour. Seeing that he knew her to be old, feeble, and
paralyzed, this was most remarkable. Curberry had called her Queen Beelzebub, so
Miss Armour, and not Mrs. Jarsell, was the head of the Society of Flies, and the
cause of all the trouble. In a weak way, Dan considered that she evidently was
not so old as she had made herself out to be, and certainly she was not
paralyzed. No woman without the use of her limbs could have escaped so swiftly,
or have worked the aeroplane so dexterously. Miss Armour, the delicate,
kind-hearted old lady, was the infernal Queen Beelzebub who had spoken behind
the mask when in the darkness the scarlet light had made an accursed halo round
her head. And now she was dead--stone dead. A moment's reflection assured him
that he could not be certain on this point without examination, so he tore open
her dress, and laid his hand on her heart. It beat feebly, so he knew that she
was still alive, although she was crumpled up in a heap amidst the wreckage.
This knowledge restored Halliday more positively to his senses. She was so
dangerous that, even helpless as she appeared to be, he could not tell what
devilry she might not make use of to get the upper hand. She still had the piece
of steel tipped with the deadly snake poison, and even a feeble woman could
inflict death with that. The idea made Dan search in her pockets to secure the
subtle weapon of defence, but even while he fumbled and hunted, he was pulled
violently backward. &quot;Mr. Halliday!&quot; gasped Mrs. Jarsell, holding a lantern to
his white face, &quot;hold him,&quot; she added to a couple of men who were beside her.
&quot;I've--I've caught Queen Beelzebub red-handed,&quot; muttered Dan, striving to get on
his feet, and thinking in a muddled way that Mrs. Jarsell had seen the arrival
of the aeroplanes, the battle in the air, and the catastrophe. She must have
come stealthily across the intervening fields with her myrmidons, and thus he
had been caught unawares. He knew well that, once in her grip, since she was an
accomplice of Queen Beelzebub's, he could expect no mercy, and, what was worse,
Lillian would be in danger. He, therefore, in a weak way, fought his best to
escape. If he could only reach Mrs. Pelgrin's hotel he would be safe. But the
men were too strong for him, and he was beaten to his knees. Then, what with,
the hunger that gnawed him, the bitter cold, the fall, and the general surprise
of the situation, his senses left him. He uttered a weary sigh, and slipped to
the ground, limp and unconscious. Then, again, as had happened when Penn had
drugged him in the taxi-cab, he felt himself swallowed up in gloom; felt himself
falling interminably, and lost sight of the physical world and its surroundings.
To all intents and purposes he was dead, and from the moment he closed his eyes
in that misty meadow he remembered nothing more. When his eyes opened again,
they shut at once, for the blaze of light was painful. Dimly he fancied that he
heard a telephonic voice give an order, and he felt that some ardent spirit was
being poured down his throat. The fiery liquor put new life into him; his heart
began to beat more strongly and he felt that his weak limbs were regaining a
fictitious strength. With a thankful sigh he opened his eyes again, and a
bewildered look round made him understand that he was in the barbaric
sitting-room of The Grange. He saw the violent contrasts of red and yellow and
black, he realized the glare and glitter and oppressive splendor of the many
lamps and his nostrils were filled with the well-known Sumatra scent. Reason
came back to him with a rush, and he knew in what a dangerous position he was
placed. Here he was in the power of Queen Beelzebub and her factotum, Mrs.
Jarsell--at their mercy completely, as it were, although he was assured that he
would receive none at all. He had hunted down the gang; he was breaking up the
gang; and now in his hour of triumph he was at the mercy of the gang. Queen
Beelzebub was top, tail, and bottom of the society, and he was in her grip. She
would not relax it, he knew very well, until the life was squeezed out of him.
The realization of his danger and the memory of what his helplessness meant to
Lillian, nerved him to recover full control of his consciousness. While there
was life there was hope, and as his captors had not murdered him while he was
insensible, Dan concluded that they would not do so when he had recovered his
wits. Queen Beelzebub would play with him, he fancied, as a cat plays with a
mouse, and in that case he might find some means of escape. So far he had beaten
her all along the line, and he might beat her still, although she certainly held
the winning cards at the moment. As these things flashed across his brain, he
yawned and stretched himself, looking round in a leisurely way as he did so.
Still feeling a trifle stiff and sore, his thinking powers were nevertheless in
good working order, as they at once responded to the command of his indomitable
will. Therefore, with wonderful self-control, he smiled amiably, and stared into
every corner, in order to spy out the weakness of the land. But he was being
watched, as he soon knew, and his thought was read. &quot;No,&quot; snarled a silvery
voice, higher in tone than that of Mrs. Jarsell, &quot;I have you and I mean to keep
you.&quot; Queen Beelzebub, alive and well, and as completely in possession of her
senses as he was, sat in her big carved chair near the open fireplace just as
she had sat when he paid that long distant visit with Freddy Laurance and
Mildred. Her face was as wrinkled as ever, but instead of being of the ivory hue
which had impressed him on a former occasion, it was deadly white, and looked
particularly venomous. Her white hair had been smoothly brushed and she wore a
loose cloak of scarlet velvet, which fell to her feet. But in the fall she had
suffered, since Dan noticed that her right arm was bound up in bandages and
splints, resting in a black silk scarf against her breast. His eyes fastened on
this and Miss Armour laughed in a thin, spiteful manner, which hinted at the
wrath that consumed her. &quot;Yes,&quot; she said, in answer to his mute query, &quot;I have
broken my arm, thanks to you, Mr. Halliday. You smashed my aeroplane and sent me
to the ground.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;That is what you tried to do with me,&quot; said Dan, drily, and
settling himself comfortably in his chair, since he felt convinced that he was
in no immediate danger. &quot;Tit for tat, Queen Beelzebub, or shall I call you Miss
Armour?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;The real name or the feigned name, doesn't matter,&quot; rejoined the lady
very coolly, &quot;you can call me what you like for the time you have to live.&quot;
&quot;Oh!&quot; said Halliday, equally coolly, and aware that the cat-and-mouse torment
was beginning, &quot;so that's it, is it?&quot; Mrs. Jarsell stood beside her friend's
chair, and was handing her food in an anxious manner. The large and ponderous
woman looked like a child overcome with terror. Her eyes were sunken, her cheeks
were hollow, and the immense vitality she possessed appeared to be at a very low
ebb. She was arrayed in white, as usual, but her garb was not so colorless as
her face. She even looked smaller than formerly, and was shrunken in her
clothes. There was something pitiful in the spectacle of this large phlegmatic
female broken down, worn out, and overcome with dread of the future. As she
attended to Miss Armour the tears rolled down her face, which had so suddenly
grown old. The sight seemed to irritate the other woman, who was much more
frail, but who had a much more powerful will. Dan saw in a flash that he had
been mistaken in thinking that Mrs. Jarsell was strong. Her strength lay in her
imposing looks, but she was the mere tool of that fragile, delicate old lady,
whose glittering eyes revealed the iron will which dominated her weak age-worn
body. Here, indeed, was the true Queen Beelzebub, driven into a corner and
prepared to fight to the last. Halliday felt, with a creeping of the flesh, that
he had come to grips with an evil power, which it would be desperately hard to
conquer. Miss Armour saw the shadow in his eyes. &quot;You're afraid,&quot; she taunted
him. Dan agreed. &quot;Not physically, you understand,&quot; he said quietly, &quot;but you
seem to be so thoroughly wicked that the spiritual part of myself quails for the
moment. But it doesn't matter much, you know, seeing that you have much more
cause to fear that I may shoot you at sight,&quot; and he fumbled in his pocket for
Curberry's revolver which he had picked up when leaving the room. &quot;I removed
that when you were insensible,&quot; gasped Mrs. Jarsell, wiping her eyes and turning
a heavy white face in his direction. &quot;Of course,&quot; said Miss Armour, in a hard
voice. &quot;I ordered the search to be made in case you had any weapons. Now you are
quite defenceless, and at my mercy, you meddling ape.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;How long have I been
insensible,&quot; asked Dan, ignoring the feminine spite which led her to call him
names. &quot;For quite an hour,&quot; sighed Mrs. Jarsell, whose great body was shaking as
if with the ague. &quot;I had you brought here along with Miss Armour. You were both
in a kind of faint. Now you are all right, and----&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;And I am all right,&quot;
finished Miss Armour, imperiously, &quot;which is much more to the purpose. Better
had you died when you fell from the aeroplane, Mr. Halliday, than have recovered
so completely as you seem to have done.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;You mean mischief?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Oh, yes, I mean
mischief,&quot; replied Queen Beelzebub amiably, &quot;and I mean torture, such as will
make you wince. I'll prove what sort of a man you are.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;You had better make
haste, then,&quot; said Dan, with a shrug, and bracing up his courage to beat this
fiend with her own weapons, &quot;by this time the police know all about Curberry.&quot;
&quot;What's that to me. The police can't connect me with his death?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Not so far as
you know, but as my friend, Laurance, promised to take action at five o'clock,
if he did not hear from me, I expect with the Blackheath and Hampstead
inspectors he is now in Lord Curberry's house. An explanation from him will soon
bring the authorities to this den.&quot; Mrs. Jarsell burst into hysterical tears. &quot;I
knew there was great danger,&quot; she wailed. &quot;I knew the end had come!&quot; and she
sank at Miss Armour's feet in a fit of despair, the picture of a beaten woman.
&quot;Oh, shut up, Eliza,&quot; said Queen Beelzebub savagely, and her eyes glittered more
venomously than ever, &quot;you always play the fool when wits are needed to keep
things straight.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;You can't keep them straight,&quot; said Dan calmly, lounging in
his chair, &quot;your career is at an end, Miss Armour.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;We'll see about that, Mr.
Halliday. Oh, you needn't look at me in that way, my friend. I still have the
snake-poisoned lancet, you know, and if you try to spring on me, even though my
arm is broken, you will meet with a sudden and unpleasant death.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I don't want
to touch you,&quot; retorted Halliday. &quot;I shall leave the hangman to finish you off.&quot;
&quot;That he never shall do,&quot; snapped Miss Armour, her eyes flashing and her
nostrils dilating, &quot;not one member of that glorious society I have founded shall
ever be done to death by those accursed people in authority. I, and my subjects
who obey me so loyally, will vanish.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Will you? Not while the ports and railway
stations are watched,&quot; sneered Halliday, with contempt, &quot;and I don't think your
friend Vincent can supply aeroplanes in sufficient quantity for you all to get
away. Even if you did by some extraordinary chance, the world would be hunted
for you.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;It can be hunted from the North Pole to the South, Mr. Halliday, but
neither the members of the Society of Flies nor its queen will be discovered. We
will be as if we had never been,&quot; she concluded triumphantly, and as she spoke
the big woman, sobbing at her feet, shivered and shook, and uttered a muffled
cry of terror. Queen Beelzebub kicked her. &quot;Get up, Eliza, you fool,&quot; she said
contemptuously, &quot;you know quite well that I have made ready for everything this
long time.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;But I don't want to----&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;If you say another word,&quot; interrupted
Miss Armour, viciously, &quot;you shall afford sport for this society as this
meddling beast shall do.&quot; Dan laughed gaily, determined not to show the white
feather, although his heart was filled with fear. He did not mind a clean,
short, sharp death, but he did not wish to be tortured and mutilated, as he
believed this incarnate demon intended he should be. Curiously enough, his
laugh, instead of exciting Queen Beelzebub to further wrath, seemed to extort
her unwilling admiration. &quot;You are a brave man, Mr. Halliday,&quot; she muttered
reluctantly; then burst out furiously, &quot;oh, you young fool, why did you not
accept the offer I made you?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;The offer you prophesied in this very room would
be made,&quot; said Halliday complacently, &quot;well, you see, Miss Armour, or Queen
Beelzebub, or whatever you like to call yourself, I happen to have a
conscience.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;That is your weakness,&quot; said the woman calmly; &quot;throw it on the
rubbish heap, my friend. It is useless.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Now it is, so far as joining your
infernal organization is concerned, I am quite sure. To-morrow the police will
be here, and the Society of Flies will cease to exist.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;That is possible, and
yet may not be probable, Mr. Halliday. If the Society does cease to exist, it
will not do so in the way you contemplate. Eliza!&quot; added Miss Armour
impatiently, &quot;if you will sniff and howl, go and do so in some other room. I
can't stand you just now. My nerves are shaken, and my arm is hurting me. Go
away.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;And leave you with----&quot; Mrs. Jarsell cast a terrified look at Dan.
&quot;Pooh!&quot; cried Queen Beelzebub contemptuously, &quot;you don't think that I am afraid
of him. I have the lancet with the snake-poison, and if he tries to get out of
the door or the window you know very well that every exit is watched. Go away
and employ your time better than sobbing and moaning. You know what you have to
do, you poor silly fool?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yes,&quot; sighed Mrs. Jarsell, and stumbled towards the
door like a rebuked infant. &quot;I'll send the telegrams before eight. But the
village post-office will learn too much if I send them.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Never mind. The whole
world will learn too much before to-morrow night, my dear Eliza. However,
neither you nor I, nor anyone else concerned, will be here to get into trouble.&quot;
Mrs. Jarsell threw her hands above her head. &quot;The end has come; the end has
come,&quot; she wailed tearfully, &quot;we are lost, lost, lost!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I know that as well as
you do,&quot; said Miss Armour cheerfully, &quot;thanks to this idiot here. However, he
shall pay for his meddling.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;But if the police----&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;If you don't get out,&quot;
interrupted Queen Beelzebub in a cold fury, &quot;I shall prick you with the
lancet--you know what that means.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;It would be better than the other thing,&quot;
moaned Mrs. Jarsell, clinging to the door, which she had opened. &quot;What other
thing?&quot; inquired Halliday, on the alert for information. Queen Beelzebub
replied. &quot;You shall know before you die! Eliza, will you go and send those
telegrams, you silly fool? If you don't obey me----&quot; the woman's face took on
such a wicked expression that Mrs. Jarsell, with a piteous cry, fled hastily,
closing the door after her. Then Miss Armour drank a little of the wine that was
on the table beside her and looked smilingly at her prisoner. &quot;I never could
make anything of Eliza,&quot; she explained, &quot;always a whimpering cry-baby. I
wouldn't have had her in the society but that I wished to use this house, which
belongs to her, and of course when we started her money was useful.&quot; Halliday,
being alone, glanced around to see if he could escape. He could not attack Miss
Armour, old and feeble as she was, because of the poisoned piece of steel which
she had concealed about her. He had seen the effects on Sir Charles Moon, and
did not wish to risk so sudden a death. For the sake of Lillian it was necessary
that he should live, since, if he did not, there was no one left to protect her;
therefore, he did not think of meddling with Queen Beelzebub, but cast an
anxious look at windows and door. Escape that way was equally impossible, as all
were guarded. There seemed to be nothing for it but to wait and take what chance
offered itself later. He could see none at the moment. The position was
unpleasant, especially when he remembered that he was to be tortured, but his
manhood prevented his showing the least sign of fear. To intimate that he cared
nothing for her threats, he took out his pipe and tobacco pouch. &quot;Do you mind my
smoking, Miss Armour?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Not at all, unless you would rather eat. There's food on
the table behind you. Oh,&quot; she laughed, when she saw the expression on his face,
as he glanced around, &quot;don't be alarmed, I don't intend to poison you. That
death will be too easy. You can eat and drink and smoke with perfect safety. I
intend to end your life in a less merciful manner.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Well,&quot; said Dan, going to
the table and taking a sandwich, together with a glass of port wine. &quot;I think
you are spiteful enough to give me a bad time before dying, so I am quite sure
that I can eat and drink with safety!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Oh, what a pity; what a pity,&quot; said Miss
Armour thoughtfully, when the young man returned to his seat and began to make a
hurried meal. &quot;What's a pity?&quot; asked Dan carelessly. &quot;That you and I should be
enemies. I gave you the chance to be friendly with me, you know, but you
wouldn't take it. Yet I admire you, and have always admired you. You have
courage, brains, coolness, and persistence. These are valuable qualities such as
I needed for a member of my society. If I had not seen that you possessed them
and wished to make use of them by binding you to my society, I should have ended
your life long ago.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;As Sir Charles Moon's life was ended; as Durwin's life was
cut short; as Penn was disposed of, and as Lord Curberry was dispatched.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Well,
no. Curberry poisoned himself because he feared that everything was about to
come out.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;As it will.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Probably,&quot; said Queen Beelzebub indifferently, &quot;but
there are yet some hours before the end. No, my friend, you will not die like
those you have mentioned. Your cleverness demands a more ingenious death.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;You
are a very clever woman,&quot; said Dan, finishing his glass of port. &quot;I am. You will
admire my cleverness when you----&quot; she checked herself and laughed. &quot;I knew a
Chinese mandarin once and he told me many things, Mr. Halliday. You can guess
what he told me.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Something about torture?&quot; said Dan, lighting his pipe, &quot;quite
so. You go to the Chinese to learn how to hurt a man. I thought you were more
original.&quot; Miss Armour sneered. &quot;Isn't this indifference rather overdone, Mr.
Halliday?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Well, it is a trifle. I'm in a blue funk, and can you blame me,&quot; he
shuddered, &quot;a man doesn't like to die by inches, you know. However, as we
understand one another, suppose we wile away the time by your telling me how you
came to start this damned gang of yours.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;My dear young friend, I admire your
courage so much that I can refuse you nothing,&quot; mocked Miss Armour, wincing as
she moved her broken arm. &quot;I really should be in bed with my hurt.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;You'll get
feverish if you don't lay up,&quot; Dan advised her. &quot;Oh, I don't think so. I know
about other drugs than the Sumatra scent, Mr. Halliday. Of course, a broken
arm,&quot; she added with a sigh, &quot;can't be mended by all the drugs in the world.
Time alone can put it right, and, thanks to you, I shan't have time to get
cured. If you had only fought with me instead of against me, this would not have
happened. Well, my society----&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yes. What about your society?&quot; questioned Dan,
politely and easily. Queen Beelzebub cast an admiring look in his direction and
began to speak in a quiet lady-like manner, as though she were presiding at a
tea-table, and the subject of conversation was quite an ordinary one. &quot;I was
left an orphan at an early age,&quot; she said leisurely, &quot;poor and honest and
friendless. For years I led what you fools call a decent life, earning my bread
by going out as a governess. But poverty and honesty did not please me,
especially since the first was the outcome of the last. I never wished to marry,
as I did not care for men. I did not wish for society, or fame, or flirtation,
or, indeed, anything a woman usually longs for. I desired power!&quot; and as she
uttered the last word an infernal expression of pride came over her white and
delicate face. &quot;Power for a bad purpose?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Well, you see, Mr. Halliday, I could
not get power for a good one. The sole way in which I could obtain my ends was
to appeal to people's self-love. I read of those Italian societies, and the way
in which they terrorized the world. Whatever the members of those societies want
they get, because they work by blackmail, by threats, by the knife, and with
poison. I always wished to found a society of that sort, but I noticed how
frequently things went wrong because the members of various societies got mixed
up with women, or drank too much, or gave themselves away in a moment of
profligacy.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Ah,&quot; Dan smoked calmly, &quot;now I understand why your rules were so
stringent.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;You speak of them in a past tense,&quot; said Miss Armour curiously.
&quot;Well,&quot; Dan pressed down the tobacco in his pipe, &quot;the society is done for; it's
gastados, used up, busted, and all the rest of it. Well?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Well,&quot; echoed the
woman, passing over his remark with a sneer. &quot;I wished to collect a body of men
and women who were to live like saints and use all the power such self-denial
gave them to gain all they wanted for themselves.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;A devilishly clever scheme.&quot;
&quot;But not original, like my tortures,&quot; Queen Beelzebub assured him. &quot;In
Australia--Sydney, New South Wales--I fancy there are societies who have the
same rules. They call such an organization there a 'Push!' I think.&quot; Dan nodded.
&quot;I have heard of such things.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Well, then--to make a long story short, as I
want to go to bed, and can't enjoy your delightful society much longer--I
intended to work on those lines. Years and years ago Mrs. Jarsell was a favorite
pupil of mine. We parted and she married a man with money. He died,&quot; Miss Armour
laughed, &quot;in fact, since he treated Eliza badly, I got rid of him.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Oh, so that
is the hold you have on her.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Quite so. I met her again and got rid of the
husband. He left her his money and I came to live with Eliza as a companion. For
a time we went into London society, and I soon managed to get a few people
together by appealing to their egotism. Some kicked at my ideas--others did not,
and in the end I collected quite a large number. Then I made Eliza take this
house, as it struck me that aeroplanes might be utilized for criminal purposes.
I don't say that when this idea struck me aeroplanes were so good as they are
now, but I believed that aviation would improve, and that the air would be
conquered. Chance brought Vincent into my life. He became a member of the
Society of Flies, and manufactured the machines. He also taught me how to handle
them----&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I am bound to say that he had an excellent pupil,&quot; put in Dan
politely. &quot;Thank you,&quot; Miss Armour smiled and nodded. &quot;I fancy I am pretty good.
But you see that by using an aeroplane I was able to get up and down to London
without people knowing. I was, so to speak, in two places at once, by travelling
fast, and so could prove an alibi easily.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Then Durwin?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;No. Eliza murdered
him. She went up in an aeroplane along with Vincent, since she is too silly to
handle one herself. To kill Moon--that was my work because he learned too much
and refused to join me--I went to town by train in the character of the false
Mrs. Brown. Penn was killed by Curberry, who had to obey me or suffer himself.
Oh, I assure you I am quite autocratic, Mr. Halliday,&quot; finished the woman
merrily. &quot;I quite believe that,&quot; said Halliday drily, &quot;but did all this villainy
give you pleasure?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Oh, yes,&quot; Miss Armour's nostrils again dilated, and her
eyes again flashed triumphantly, &quot;think of the power I held until you
interfered. I pretended for greater safety to be paralyzed, and no one ever
connected a poor invalid lady with Queen Beelzebub.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I did not, I assure you. I
believed Queen Beelzebub to be Mrs. Jarsell.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Eliza,&quot; Miss Armour scoffed,
&quot;why, she's a poor weak fool, and only did what I ordered her to do because I
implicated her along with myself in the murder of her husband. However, she has
been useful, as, without her money, I could not have started the business.
Power!&quot; she repeated, &quot;yes, I have a great power. High or low, rich or poor,
there was no one I could not remove if I chose. My subjects worked for me
willingly, or unwillingly.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;You are a kind of 'Old Woman of the Mountain,' like
the gentleman of that name who invented the Assassins--that gang about the time
of the Crusades.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Quite so, although it is not polite of you to call me an old
woman. By the way, I got Curberry his title by getting rid of his uncle and
cousin.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yes. So he told me,&quot; said Dan, marvelling that the woman could speak
so calmly about her wickedness. &quot;Oh, you are shocked,&quot; she laughed gaily, &quot;what
a fool you are. I could tell you much concerning many murders and disappearances
which the police knew nothing about. For some years I have ruled like a despot,
and--and--well,&quot; she yawned, &quot;it's all over. Oh, what a pity.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I think not.
People will sleep quieter when they know Queen Beelzebub and her demons are
harmless.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Harmless,&quot; she echoed the word with a laugh, and touched a silver
bell that stood at her elbow, &quot;we shall all be harmless enough to-morrow, if
indeed you speak truly, and your friend Laurance is coming up here with the
police.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;He is, I assure you,&quot; said Dan, wondering why she rang the bell, &quot;but
who are the members of your gang?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;You'll see them to-morrow, when you afford
sport for them,&quot; said Queen Beelzebub in a weary way, and looking fagged out,
&quot;meanwhile, I must have you safely locked up,&quot; and as she spoke, two big men
entered the room. &quot;Hang you, I shan't,&quot; began Dan, and sprang to his feet. But
the two men had their hands on him, and shortly he was trussed up like a
Christmas turkey. &quot;You are less clever than I thought,&quot; said Queen Beelzebub,
sneering, &quot;or you would not fight against impossibilities. Good night! Take him
away.&quot; And as they were commanded, the two big men took him away in silence.</p>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<h4>CHAPTER XX</h4>
<h5><a name="div1_20" href="#div1Ref_20">QUEEN BEELZEBUB'S END</a></h5>
<br>

<p>Unable to resist superior force, Dan ceased to
struggle, thinking it was best to play a waiting game, until chance afforded him
the opportunity of escape. Hitherto his good fortune had saved him from grave
perils, and he trusted that finally it would prove strong enough to extricate
him from this last difficulty. He was taken down a short flight of damp steps
and thrust into what he took to be a disused coal-cellar. Here the two big men
released him from his bonds and retired, locking the door behind them. Once or
twice he asked questions, but, receiving no reply, he asked no more. They left a
lantern for his use, and the light, although only that of a candle, was very
acceptable in the cimmerian darkness of this underground dungeon. When left
alone, the prisoner stretched himself, swung his arms and stamped with his feet
to get warm, after which he made an examination of his surroundings. Halliday
found that the cellar was small, with stone floor, stone roof, and stone walls,
all more or less humid. Light and air came through a shaft on the right of the
entrance, which was too narrow to permit of escape. Evidently the place had been
used before as a prison, and no doubt for refractory members of the society,
since there was some spare furniture. In one corner was a low bed, in another a
deal table, in a third a washstand, and finally there was one kitchen chair, on
which Dan took his seat to think over matters. He had eaten, so did not feel
hungry, and solaced himself with his pipe, a luxury for which he felt very
grateful. It could not be said that his thoughts were pleasant; they could
scarcely be so, under the circumstances, as there was no denying he was in a
most uncomfortable plight. So Miss Armour, the delicate maiden lady, was Queen
Beelzebub, and the imposing Mrs. Jarsell was only her tool. Dan was surprised
when he reflected on this, and could not help admiring the infernal cunning of
the woman who had arranged matters. Miss Armour was without doubt a born
criminal, who much preferred doing evil to doing good. As Mrs. Jarsell's
companion, she could have led a blameless existence, surrounded by attention and
comfort and luxury, but her craving for power had led her into dark paths. For
all her care, she might have guessed that in a law-abiding country the truth of
her murderous association would come to the notice of the authorities sooner or
later. And, when the knowledge had become public, with all her cunning, she was
unable to cope with the situation. Like the fox in the fable, her many wiles had
proved useless, and here she was driven into a corner. What she intended to do
Dan could not think. He did not see in what way she could escape punishment. Of
course, the young man was perfectly satisfied that Freddy was moving in the
matter down South. According to instructions, he must have gone to Lord
Curberry's house at Blackheath when he failed to receive news of his friend, and
what he discovered there would assure him that it was time to take public action
and inform the police of what was going on. The servants would be questioned and
Curberry's body would be examined, while the visit of the veiled woman and her
flight in the aeroplane would be explained. Laurance would guess at once that
the unknown lady was Queen Beelzebub attending to her iniquitous business, and
an inquiry at the shed would soon inform him of the pursuit. Halliday believed
that on the morrow Laurance, together with the police, would arrive at Sheepeak,
and then the end would come. Meanwhile he was in great danger unless Freddy
appeared in time to rescue him, for Miss Armour was very spiteful and her last
act of power would undoubtedly be to murder him for the action he had taken in
bringing about her downfall. But this had to be faced, and, if death was
certain, he hoped that it would be immediate, since even his brave nature
quailed at the idea of suffering ingenious Chinese tortures. As to Lillian, Dan
was quite sure she would not be harmed, because Queen Beelzebub had her hands
full and would not have time to kill her. Indeed, if she decided to do so, it
would not be easy for her to find anyone to execute her commands, for every
member of the Society of Flies must by this time have been aware of the danger
which threatened their organization. Halliday believed that the telegrams
alluded to by Miss Armour and which were to be sent by Mrs. Jarsell were
intended to summon the members to a conference. Yet, what use such a meeting
would be, the young man could not think. The net of the law would capture the
entire gang without doubt. And yet Queen Beelzebub was so infernally cunning
that Dan could not be sure she would not find some means of saving herself and
her subjects, even at the eleventh hour. In thoughts such as these the night
passed slowly and the hours seemed interminable. The candle in the lantern
burned itself out, and he found himself in complete darkness, while the silence
was only broken by the drip of water from the walls, or by his own breathing and
restless movements. Dan felt as though he were in a tomb, and his lively
imagination conjured up all kinds of horrors until, worn out physically and
mentally, he fell into a profound slumber. When he opened his eyes again, it was
dawn, for he saw the cold light streaming down through the air shaft. A glance
at his watch assured him that it was seven o'clock, and he wondered if food
would be brought to him shortly. As he had only eaten a sandwich and drank a
glass of port-wine since a yesterday morning breakfast, he felt most uncommonly
hungry, and, in spite of the peril in which he stood, he longed ardently for
food. In the meantime, for comfort, he lighted his pipe again, sat on his bed,
and watched the thin beam of sunlight move slowly across the stone floor of his
cell. This was an unexpected adventure, sure enough, and, unpleasant as it was
now, it promised to be still more unpleasant before it was concluded. All that
Halliday could hope for was that Laurance, with the police, would arrive in time
to save his life, and deliver him from imprisonment. At ten o'clock--Dan looked
again at his watch when the door opened--Mrs. Jarsell entered with a tray, on
which were two boiled eggs, bread and butter, and coffee. Placing this on the
table, she was about to leave, as she had entered, in silence, when Dan caught
her dress. At once, with a shiver, she drew back and displayed the lancet tipped
with the serpent-poison. &quot;If you try to escape, I shall kill you,&quot; she said in
her heavy voice. Dan looked at her curiously, and saw that she was less imposing
than ever for all her massive looks. All her self-restraint was gone, her eyes
were red; her face was disfigured with tears; and her big body looked flabby and
inert. A greater collapse or a more pitiful spectacle can scarcely be imagined,
and Dan felt quite sorry for her, even though he knew she was banded against him
with others to bring him to a cruel death. &quot;I shall not try to escape,&quot; he said,
slowly; &quot;that is, I shan't try just now.&quot; Pausing at the door, Mrs. Jarsell,
still on guard with the lancet, looked at him sorrowfully. &quot;You can never
escape,&quot; she said brokenly, &quot;try as you may, for the house is guarded by four
men, who are sworn to obey Miss Armour.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Queen Beelzebub, you mean,&quot; said
Halliday with a shrug. &quot;I wish I had never heard the name,&quot; cried Mrs. Jarsell
with a sob. &quot;I quite believe that. I am very sorry for you.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;You have every
need to be. Thanks to you, we are all caught in a trap, and there is no means of
escape.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Really. I thought that Miss Armour----&quot; Mrs. Jarsell shuddered. &quot;She
has an idea, but I hope it will not be necessary for her to carry out her idea.
After all, things may not be so bad as they seem, Mr. Halliday.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;If you mean
the police, I am afraid they are,&quot; he retorted with another shrug and with great
emphasis; &quot;by this time my friend Laurance has informed the Scotland Yard
authorities of what we know.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;What do you know?&quot; demanded Mrs. Jarsell, with a
gasp, and she was forced to lean against the door for support. &quot;Everything,&quot;
said Dan, briefly; &quot;so with your permission I shall have my breakfast, Mrs.
Jarsell,&quot; and he began to eat with a good appetite. &quot;Oh, how can you; how can
you?&quot; cried the big woman, convulsively; &quot;think of the danger you stand in.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I
shall escape!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Escape, and from Queen Beelzebub? Nobody has ever escaped her.&quot;
&quot;I shall, and you will be the means of my escaping.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Me?&quot; Mrs. Jarsell used bad
grammar in her astonishment; &quot;how can I----&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;That is your affair,&quot; broke in
Halliday, pouring out the coffee. &quot;Why should I help you to escape?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Because
you are a woman and not a fiend. Miss Armour is one, I admit, but I can see very
plainly that you are a most unwilling accomplice.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I am, I am,&quot; cried Mrs.
Jarsell, vehemently; &quot;years ago I was a decent woman, a good woman. She came
into my life again and poisoned my existence. She worked on my jealousy and on
my fear and----&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I know; I know. She enabled you to get rid of your husband.&quot;
&quot;Ah!&quot; Mrs. Jarsell reeled back as though she had been struck; &quot;she told you
that, did she?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;She told me everything.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Then you will never escape; she would
never let you go free with the knowledge you have of her secrets. You are
doomed. As to my husband,&quot; Mrs. Jarsell appeared to be speaking more to herself
than to Dan, &quot;he was a wicked and cruel wretch. He starved me, he beat me, he
was unfaithful to me, and led me such a life as no woman could endure. Miss
Armour showed me how to rid myself of him, when I was distraught with misery and
passion. I thought it was sympathy with me that made her help me. It was not.
All she desired was to gain some hold over me, and use my money for her own vile
ends.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;You don't appear to love her,&quot; said Halliday, coolly. The woman closed
the door, placed her back against it and clenched her hands in a cold fury. &quot;I
hate her; I loathe her; I detest her,&quot; she cried, in a guttural voice, evidently
consumed with rage. &quot;For years and years and years I have been her slave. After
I killed my husband, under her directions--although I don't deny but what he
deserved death--there was no retreat for me, as she could have, and would have,
informed the police. I should have been hanged. She made use of her power to use
my money in order to create this wicked society. It murders and slays and
blackmails and----&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I know; I know,&quot; said Dan, soothingly; &quot;she told me all
about it.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Then you know how evil she is! I have had to commit crimes, from
which my better self shrank, at her command.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Such as the murder of Durwin,&quot;
put in Dan, quickly. &quot;That is only one out of many. Deeper and deeper I have
sunk into the mire and now the end has come. I am glad of it.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Why not turn
king's evidence, and denounce this woman and her gang? Then you would be
pardoned.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;There is no pardon for my wickedness,&quot; said Mrs. Jarsell, in a
sombre tone. &quot;I have sown, and I must reap as I have sown. It is too late. I
know that your friend will come with the police. They will find the whole wicked
lot of criminals here, which constitute the Society of Flies.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Ah! those
telegrams?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yes. I sent off thirty last night, for now Penn and Curberry are
dead there are just thirty members. Today all will come up, since the danger to
all is so great. I sent the wires last night, and I am confident that the
members have started for Sheepeak this morning. This afternoon everyone will be
under this roof. All the worse for you.&quot; Dan quailed. &quot;Does she really mean to
torture me?&quot; he asked nervously, and it was little to be wondered at that such a
prospect did make him feel sick. &quot;Yes, she does,&quot; rejoined Mrs. Jarsell,
gloomily; &quot;when the members find that there is no escape, they will be delighted
to see the man who had brought this danger on them mutilated and done to death
by inches.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;A pleasant set of people,&quot; muttered Dan, bracing himself to meet
the worst, &quot;but I think you would not care to see me tortured.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;No, I wouldn't.
You are brave, and young, and clever, and handsome----&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;And,&quot; added Dan,
quickly, thinking of a means to move her to help him. &quot;I am to marry Lillian
Moon. Surely you have some sympathy with me and with her?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Supposing I have;
what can I do?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Help me to escape,&quot; said Dan, persuasively. &quot;It's impossible,&quot;
she growled, and went suddenly away, closing the door after her with a bang that
sounded in Dan's ears like his death-warrant. All the same, with the courage of
a brave nature, and the hopefulness inseparable from youth, he went on with his
meal, hoping for the best. Mrs. Jarsell was moved by his plight; he saw that,
and, deeply stained as she was with compulsory crimes, she might hope to atone
for them by doing one good act. At the eleventh hour she might set him free, and
undoubtedly she would think over what he had said. This woman, unlike the
others, was not entirely evil, and the seeds of good in her breast might bring
forth repentance and a consequent help. Dan knew that he was clinging to a
straw, but in his present dilemma there was nothing else to cling to. After
breakfast he lay down again, and again began to smoke. For hours he waited to
hear his fate, sometimes stretched on his bed, sometimes seated in the chair and
occasionally walking up and down the confined space of his cell. He could not
disguise from himself that things were desperate. His sole hope of escape lay
with Mrs. Jarsell, and that was but a slight one. Even though her remorse might
wish to aid him, her terror of Queen Beelzebub might be too strong to let her
move in the matter. Halliday was uncommonly brave and extraordinarily hopeful,
yet the perspiration beaded his forehead, and he shivered at the prospect of
torture. Without doubt he was in hell, and the devils presided over by the
infernal queen were waiting to inflict pains and penalties on him. It terrified
him to think that---- &quot;But this won't do,&quot; said Dan to himself, as he heard the
key grate in the lock, late in the afternoon. &quot;I must pull myself together and
smile. Whatever these beasts do to me, I must die game. But--but--Lillian.&quot; With
a quiet smile he turned to greet Mrs. Jarsell, who did not look him in the face,
nor did she even speak. With a gesture, he was invited to come out, and for the
moment had a wild idea of escape as soon as he reached the upper portion of that
wicked house. But the sight of the lancet in her hand prevented him from making
a dash for liberty. He knew that the merest scratch would make him a corpse, so
it was not worth while to risk the attempt. Only when he was at the door of the
barbaric sitting-room he whispered to Mrs. Jarsell, &quot;You will help me to escape.
I know you will. Even now you are thinking of ways and means.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Perhaps,&quot; she
gasped in a low whisper; then hastily flung open the door and pushed him into
the room. With that word of hope ringing in his ears, Halliday faced his judges
with a smile on his lips. The room was filled with people, who greeted his
entrance with a roar of anger. He was spat upon, struck at, kicked and shaken by
those despairing creatures, whom he had brought to book. Queen Beelzebub, seated
in her big chair, at the end of the apartment, smiled viciously when she saw his
reception, but did not interfere for some moments. Then she waved her hand. &quot;Let
him be; let him be,&quot; she said, in her malicious, silvery voice; &quot;you shall have
all the revenge you desire. But let everything be done in order.&quot; Left alone by
the furies, Halliday stood with his back to the door, and with Mrs. Jarsell on
guard beside him. He glanced round at the pallid faces and thought that he had
never seen such an assemblage of terror. There were old men and young men, mixed
with women of the higher and lower classes. Some were well-dressed, while others
were badly clothed; some were handsome and others were ugly. But one and all
bore the mark of despair written on their white faces and in their agonized
eyes. It was like a gathering of the damned and only the individual who had
damned them, one and all, seemed to be unmoved. Queen Beelzebub appeared calm
and unshaken, looking at her prisoner quietly and speaking in a tranquil manner.
Dan found himself wondering if this creature was indeed a human being or a
fiend. &quot;We are all here,&quot; said Miss Armour, in a dignified manner, and, waving
her hand again, this time to indicate the assembly, &quot;this is the Society of
Flies which you see face to face for the first and the last time. You have
brought us together for an unpleasant purpose----&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;To torture and murder me, I
suppose,&quot; said Halliday, with studied insolence, and bracing his courage with
the memory of Mrs. Jarsell's whispered word. &quot;No. That part of our business is
pleasant,&quot; Queen Beelzebub assured him. &quot;I look forward to enjoyment when I see
you writhing in torment. But the unpleasant purpose is the disbanding of our
society.&quot; A wail of terror arose from those present. Some dropped on their knees
and beat the ground with their foreheads; others stood stiff and terror-struck,
while a few dropped limply on the floor, grovelling in despair. Since all these
people were criminals, who had inflicted death and sorrow on others, it was
strange how they hated a dose of their own medicine. Even in the midst of his
fears, Dan found himself wondering at the illogicality of the degenerate mob,
who expected to do evil and yet enjoy peace. Then he remembered that cruelty
always means cowardice, and no longer marvelled at the expression of dread and
fear on every ghastly face. &quot;How I propose to disband our society,&quot; went on
Queen Beelzebub, quite unmoved by that agonized wail, &quot;there is no need for you
to know. It may be that we shall break up, and each one will go here, there, and
the other place. It is certain that we cannot keep together since I have
received news of the police being after us.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Headed by Laurance.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Exactly.
Headed by your friend Laurance. I should like to punish him, but there is no
time, so you will have to bear his punishment as well as your own, Mr. Halliday.
What have you to say why we should not torture you and kill you, and force you
to die by inches?&quot; Fists were shaken, feet were stamped, and a dozen voices
asked the same question. Dan looked round at his foes calmly, and shrugged his
shoulders in contempt. There was a burst of jeering laughter. &quot;You won't look
like that,&quot; said Queen Beelzebub, significantly, &quot;when----&quot; she broke off with a
dreadful laugh and glanced at the fire-place. There Dan saw irons of curious
shape, pincers and files and tongs, and, what was worst of all, in the centre of
the flames reddened a circle of steel. He could not help turning pale as he
guessed that this would be placed on his head, and again he comforted himself
with the memory that Mrs. Jarsell, even at the eleventh hour, might help him.
When he changed color, there was a second burst of laughter, and Halliday glared
fiercely around. &quot;Are you human beings or fiends?&quot; he asked, &quot;to think of
torturing me. Kill me if you will, but shame as men and women should prevent you
mutilating a man who has done you no harm.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;No harm?&quot; It was Queen Beelzebub
who spoke, while her subjects snarled like ill-fed beasts. &quot;You dare to say that
when you have brought us to this pass?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I acted in the cause of law and order,&quot;
said Dan, boldly. &quot;We despise law and order.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yet you are now being brought to
book by what you despise,&quot; retorted the prisoner, and again there came that
unhuman snarl. &quot;The more you speak in that way the worse it will be for you,&quot;
said Miss Armour, coldly; &quot;yet you can escape some tortures if you will tell us
all how you came to learn the truth about us.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I don't care a damn about your
tortures,&quot; said Dan, valiantly, &quot;and I will explain what you ask just to show
that, clever as your organization is, it cannot escape discovery. Nor has it.
You are all snared here like rats in a trap, and, should you venture out of this
house, you will be caught by the authorities, to be hanged as you deserve.&quot; A
howl of rage went up, and Queen Beelzebub waved her hand once more. &quot;All in good
time,&quot; she said, quietly; &quot;let us hear what he has to explain.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;It was the
Sumatra scent on the body of Sir Charles Moon which put me on the track,&quot;
declared Dan, folding his arms. &quot;I traced it to Penn, who told me a lie about
it. I believed him at the moment and disbelieved him when I smelt the same
perfume in this very room.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Here?&quot; questioned Miss Armour, and for the first
time her face wore an expression of dismay, as if she had been caught napping.
&quot;Yes. If you remember, I spoke about your cards being scented. You told me a lie
about it. But that clue connected you with Moon's murder. I watched you and I
watched Mrs. Jarsell. I saw her face in a cinematograph which was taken on the
day of the London to York race when Durwin was murdered.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Oh!&quot; Mrs. Jarsell
gasped and moaned, and Dan could hear some of the men in impotent fury grind
their teeth. Queen Beelzebub was as calm as ever. &quot;Penn told me much when I was
taking him for that flight in which I said I would throw him overboard unless he
confessed. Then I was taken to the headquarters of your society in London, and
again smelt the perfume. I believed that Queen Beelzebub was Mrs. Jarsell, and
was astonished when I found Miss Armour played that part. Penn's confession was
not all destroyed, and my friend Laurance has by this time shown what remains of
it to the police.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;And the telegram which Curberry received?&quot; demanded Queen
Beelzebub. &quot;Laurance sent that in vague terms so as to frighten Curberry. It
did, and he committed suicide after declaring to me that he murdered Penn by
your damned orders, Miss Armour. Then----&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Thank you, we know the rest,&quot; she
said in a quiet tone, which was infinitely sinister in its suggestion; &quot;you
followed me in the aeroplane, and smashed us both up.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;He broke my machines,
the two of them,&quot; said a hoarse voice of wrath, and Dan looked sideways to see
Vincent glaring at him furiously. &quot;Well, you have fallen into your own trap,&quot;
said Queen Beelzebub, savagely. &quot;I caught you, and I hold you, and, after we
have had a conference as to how you will be tortured, you will expiate your
crimes.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Crimes,&quot; echoed Dan; &quot;that's a nice way to put the matter. I have done
a service to the State by ridding the world of all you devils. You can't escape
hanging, not one of you,&quot; and he looked defiantly round the room. &quot;We shall all
escape,&quot; said Queen Beelzebub, quietly; &quot;those who think that they will not have
no trust in me.&quot; She rose and stretched out her arms. &quot;I have never failed you;
never, never. I shall not fail you now. I swear that not a single one of you
will suffer on the gallows.&quot; Apparently her sway over the society was great, and
they believed that she could accomplish even impossibilities, for the faces of
all cleared as if by magic. The look of dread, the expression of terror
disappeared, and there only remained an uneasy feeling, as though none felt
themselves quite safe until Queen Beelzebub performed her promise. For his part,
Dan believed that the woman was lying, as he could not see how any could win
free of the net which was even now being cast over the house. &quot;You are a set of
fools, as well as a pack of wolves,&quot; cried the young man, in a vehement manner;
&quot;the police know too much for you to escape them. My friend Laurance will lead
them here; he knows this house; you are safely trapped, say what that woman
will. Thieves, rogues, liars, murderers----&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Lawyers, doctors, actors,
soldiers,&quot; scoffed Queen Beelzebub; &quot;they all belong to the Society of Flies and
you can see them here, Mr. Halliday. Some of those ladies are in society; some
are in shops; some are married, and others are not. But both men and women have
acted for the good of the society, which I have founded, to give each and
everyone what he or she desires.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;You are all devils,&quot; raged Dan, his wrath
getting the better of his discretion; &quot;red-handed criminals. The only decent one
amongst you is Mrs. Jarsell.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I am decent?&quot; gasped Mrs. Jarsell, looking up,
surprised. &quot;Yes; because you were driven by that fiend,&quot; he pointed to the
smiling Miss Armour, &quot;to compulsory crimes. You feel remorse----&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Does she?&quot;
cried Queen Beelzebub, gaily; &quot;and what good does that do, my very dear Eliza,
when you know what you have to do?&quot; Mrs. Jarsell looked at her companion with a
long and deadly look of hate, such as Dan had never thought a face was capable
of expressing. &quot;I loath and detest you,&quot; she said, slowly, &quot;but for you I would
have been a good woman. I have been driven to sin by you.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;And I shall still
drive you,&quot; shouted Queen Beelzebub, furiously; &quot;take that man away until we
decide what tortures we will inflict on him. Then when he is dead and punished
for his meddling, you will either do what I have commanded you to do, or you
shall be tortured also!&quot; The assembly, now quite certain that in some way their
head would deliver them from the talons of the law, shouted joyfully, glad to
think that two people would be done to death instead of one. Mrs. Jarsell smiled
in a faint, bitter manner. &quot;You shall be obeyed,&quot; she said, slowly; &quot;come Mr.
Halliday!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;And say your prayers,&quot; cried Queen Beelzebub, as the door opened to
let the pair out; &quot;you'll need them&quot;; and, as the door closed with Dan and Mrs.
Jarsell on the outside, the young man heard again that cruel laughter. &quot;They are
all in there,&quot; whispered the woman, catching Dan's wrist and speaking hurriedly;
&quot;the men who captured you included. The house is quite empty outside that room.
Come.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Where will you take me?&quot; inquired Dan, hanging back and wincing, for now
his fate hung in the balance, indeed. &quot;Outside; I am setting you free. Run away
and probably you will meet your friend and the police. And pray for me; pray for
me,&quot; she ended, vehemently. &quot;Why not come also,&quot; said Dan, when he found himself
at the entrance door of The Grange; &quot;you are a good woman, and----&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I am not
good. I am wicked, and may God forgive me. But I am doing one decent thing, and
that is to set you free, to marry Lillian Moon. When you leave this house, I
shall do another decent deed.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;And that is?&quot; Dan stepped outside, yet lingered
to hear her answer. &quot;You shall see. Tell the police not to come too near the
house,&quot; and in a hurry she pushed him away and bolted the door. Halliday ran for
all he was worth from that wicked dwelling. On the high road he saw a body of
men approaching, and was certain that here were the police and Laurance coming
to save him. Shouting with glee at his escape, he hastened towards them, when he
heard a sullen heavy boom like distant thunder. He looked back at The Grange and
saw a vast column of smoke towering into the sunlight. Then came a rain of
debris. At last the Society of Flies was disbanded, for the house and its wicked
inhabitants were shattered into infinitesimal fragments.</p>

<h4>CHAPTER XXI</h4>
<h5><a name="div1_21" href="#div1Ref_21">SUNSHINE</a></h5>
<br>

<p>After the storm came the calm, and with the spring a realization of Mr.
Halliday's hopes with regard to his future. Sir John Moon no longer objected to
Dan as the husband of his niece, and was indeed profoundly thankful that she had
escaped becoming Lady Curberry. The story of the Society of Flies and the
wickedness of Queen Beelzebub and the blowing up of The Grange was a nine days
wonder. The papers, for some weeks, were filled with little else, and <i>The
Moment</i> almost doubled its circulation when the able pen of Mr. Frederick
Laurance set forth the complete story. Halliday became quite a hero, as indeed
he was, although he did not appreciate the rewards of his conduct. To be
interviewed, to have his portrait, more or less unlike him, in dozens of
illustrated papers, to receive offers from music-hall managers, and even
proposals of marriage from various enthusiastic ladies, did not appeal to Dan.
As soon as he could, he went out of London and took refuge in Sir John's country
seat so as to escape publicity. Needless to say, Lillian was there, and Mrs.
Bolstreath also. Laurance was due within seven days to be Dan's best man at the
June wedding, and with him Mildred was coming at Lillian's special request.
Once, twice, and again the owner of the house had heard the story of the late
events, and also had read them more or less garbled in different newspapers. Yet
he never wearied of the recital, and admired Halliday greatly for the part he
had played. From objecting to Dan as a nephew-in-law, the baronet now urgently
desired that he should make Lillian Mrs. Halliday. In fact, when he thought of
what the young man had saved Lillian from, the uncle of the girl could not do
enough for his estimable young friend. So Dan, having become famous, was about
to become rich, but neither fame nor wealth appealed to him so much as the
undoubted fact that he was on the eve of wedding the girl he adored. &quot;And I
think,&quot; said Lillian, holding on to Dan as if she feared to lose him, &quot;that you
and I would be as happy in a cottage as in a palace. Money is a nuisance, I
think, dear.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;You say that because you have never experienced the want of it,&quot;
said Dan, in a sententious manner. All the same he slipped his arm round the
girl's slim waist, and kissed her for the pretty sentiment she had expressed
relative to a poor but Arcadian existence. The happy pair, not yet joined in
holy matrimony, but to be made one in seven days, were seated in the delightful
garden of Sir John's house, which was situated in the pleasant county of Devon.
They had strolled out after dinner, leaving Mrs. Bolstreath to chat with the
baronet, who approved of the big, placid woman, and enjoyed her society. Lillian
and Dan, however, liked to be in one another's company without any third person
to spoil their pleasures and on this occasion--being humored as lovers--they
were entirely alone. The garden sloped down to a yellow beach, which was the
curve of a tiny bay, and under the orb of a brilliant May moon the waters of the
vast sea murmured softly almost at their feet. There was a marble bench here,
with a marble statue of Cupid near at hand, perched on a pedestal, so the spot
was quite that which lovers would have chosen. Dan chose it because the screen
of shrubs and trees quite shut off the nook they occupied from the many windows
of the great house, and he could kiss Lillian when he wished, without any uneasy
feeling that someone was looking on. It is quite unnecessary to say that he
frequently availed himself of his privilege. The about-to-be bride fully
approved of his ardor in this respect. &quot;But you really must be serious,&quot; said
Miss Moon, sedately, after the last embrace given out of compliment to her
love-in-a-cottage sentiment. &quot;I want to ask you a few questions.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Ask what you
will; I can deny you nothing.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;It's about the Society of Flies,&quot; hesitated the
girl. &quot;My dear,&quot; said Dan, patiently, and coaxing a loose leaf around his cigar,
&quot;I don't want to be disagreeable, but I am really tired of the Society of
Flies.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Only a few questions,&quot; said Lillian, nestling to his side, &quot;and then we
can forget all about the matter.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;That won't be easy for me to do,&quot; replied Mr.
Halliday, rather grimly. &quot;I can never forget what I suffered when I was
expecting to be tortured by that fiend.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Queen Beelzebub?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;She could not have
chosen a better name, my dear. I sometimes doubt if she was a human being at
all.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Poor, misguided woman,&quot; murmured Lillian, resting her head on Dan's
shoulder. &quot;Don't pity her, dear. She does not deserve your pity. Now, Mrs.
Jarsell--I have always been sorry for her.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;So have I,&quot; said the girl,
promptly; &quot;she was very good to you, dear.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Good is a weak way of expressing
what I owe her,&quot; retorted Halliday; &quot;think of what she saved me from.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Perhaps
Queen Beelzebub would not have tortured you, after all.&quot; Dan laughed
incredulously. &quot;I shouldn't have cared to have trusted to her mercy. I tell you,
Lillian, as I have told you before, that already the implements of torture were
being made ready. They would have crowned me with a red-hot circlet of steel,
and pinched my flesh with red-hot pincers, and----&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Don't, oh, don't.&quot; Lillian
turned pale. &quot;It is really too dreadful. And to think that I was with Bolly at
Mrs. Pelgrin's, quite ignorant of the peril you were in. I wish I had been with
you.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I am glad you were not. My one feeling of thankfulness was that you had
escaped being hurt in any way. I didn't mind dying so long as you were all
right, my darling, although I much prefer being alive and here. Lillian, my
dear, don't cry; it's all over, weeks ago.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I--I--I can't--can't help it,&quot;
sobbed the girl, clinging to him; &quot;it is all so dreadful. When Mr. Laurance came
that day with the police and said you were at The Grange, I thought I should
have died.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;There, there,&quot; Dan soothed her, as he would have soothed a fretful
child; &quot;it is all over and done with. By the way, how was Freddy so certain that
I was at The Grange? He never quite explained his certainty.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Well, dear,&quot; said
Miss Moon, drying her eyes with Dan's handkerchief, &quot;when he did not hear from
you in London, he went down to Blackheath with Inspector Tenson of Hampstead.
They saw the local inspector and called at Lord Curberry's house, after what Mr.
Laurance told. But already a policeman had been summoned by the servants. Lord
Curberry was dead of poison, and they found his confession, saying how he had
taken it because he believed that his connection with the Society of Flies was
found out. Then the servants explained how Queen Beelzebub had come in an
aeroplane----&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;They did not call her Queen Beelzebub--the servants I mean,&quot;
said Dan, who had heard the explanation before but was glad to hear it again
told in Lillian's soft voice. &quot;No; they did not know who she was, as she was
cloaked and veiled. But they told Mr. Laurance that you had declared this veiled
lady had murdered Lord Curberry--that wasn't true, you know.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;True enough in
one sense,&quot; interrupted Dan, quickly, &quot;seeing that she drove him to suicide.
Well?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Well, then, Mr. Laurance guessed that she was Queen Beelzebub and
wondered where you were. He went to the shed where you kept your aeroplane and
heard that you had followed her. Those at the shed thought that it was a race.&quot;
&quot;It was,&quot; said Dan, grimly, again, &quot;and I won.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Mr. Laurance guessed that you
had followed her all the way to Sheepeak, although he fancied, and indeed hoped,
that both aeroplanes had broken down. He dreaded lest you should get into
trouble at Sheepeak.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Which I certainly did, although not quite in the way
Freddy expected.&quot; Lillian laughed at the memory of his escape, and rubbed her
soft face on the sleeve of his coat. &quot;Mr. Laurance told the police all about the
matter, and they wished to telegraph to Thawley, so that the police there might
go over to Sheepeak. But Mr. Laurance stopped them, as he fancied you might have
been taken captive by Queen Beelzebub, and that if such a move was made, she
might hurt you.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;She intended to hurt me very severely. And then Freddy heard
from the police about those numerous telegrams all in the same words, calling
thirty people to Sheepeak. It was the similarity of the messages that made the
telegraph authorities suspicious and, when the police came to ask--knowing where
Queen Beelzebub lived from Freddy--they were shown the telegrams.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;But by that
time all those who got the telegrams had come north,&quot; said Lillian, quite
excited; &quot;they all went up by the early train.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yes, and the police, with
Freddy, followed, delaying action until such time as they thought they could
collar the whole gang. By jove, they just came in time. Freddy was a fool to
tell you that I was in The Grange.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;He was not quite certain, and only thought
so because the wrecked aeroplanes were found in the field near the house. Oh,
Dan,&quot; Lillian put her arms round her lover's neck, &quot;Mr. Laurance told me how
thankful he was when he saw you running along the road and knew that you had
escaped.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;He might have been thankful also that I caused him and the body of
police to halt,&quot; said Dan, quickly; &quot;if they had not, everyone would have been
blown up. As it was, I very nearly got smashed by the falling sticks and stones
and what not. There must have been tons of dynamite in the cellars of The
Grange.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Who do you think put it there, Dan?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Queen Beelzebub, of course. She
said that she had made everything ready against possible discovery, and warned
poor Mrs. Jarsell that she would have to commit a last crime. Crime, by Jove.
Why the best day's work the woman ever did was to blow up that gang of devils.&quot;
&quot;I suppose Mrs. Jarsell did blow up the house, Dan?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Of course she did. Her
heart softened for some reason, and she pushed me out of danger. Then she must
have gone straight down to the cellar, and set a light to the stored dynamite.
The explosion happened so quickly after I was free that I am sure she acted in
that way. It was certainly efficacious, for not one of the blackguards, either
men or women, remained alive to be hanged.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Well, that was a good thing,&quot; said
Miss Moon, with a shudder; &quot;you know that their relatives would have been
disgraced.&quot; Dan nodded. &quot;Quite so, and the names have never become public. This
person and that person and the other person disappeared from various
neighborhoods and from various family circles. But, when the relatives read
about the explosion in Hillshire and Freddy's brilliant account of that infernal
society, they made a pretty good guess as to what had happened to the
disappearing party. Very few people gave information to the police that their
relatives or friends had disappeared. Tenson was rather annoyed, as he wanted to
make a big fuss over the matter.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I don't see what bigger fuss could have been
made, Dan. Why, the papers were filled with nothing else for weeks.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;All the
same, Tenson wanted the names of those who belonged to the gang, and people
declined to gives names of those who had disappeared from their midst. We know
that Curberry belonged to the gang, and Penn; also Mrs. Jarsell, Vincent, and
Queen Beelzebub. But only one or two other names came to light in print.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I
think,&quot; said Lillian, thoughtfully, &quot;that so many well-connected people were
mixed up in the matter that everything was hushed up as much as was possible.&quot;
&quot;H'm,&quot; said Halliday, throwing away the butt end of his cigar; &quot;it is not
unlikely that a hint was given in high quarters that no more need be said than
was absolutely necessary. Heigh ho!&quot; He rose and stretched; &quot;I am weary of the
business. Come down and walk on the beach, dear, and let us talk about
ourselves.&quot; Lillian was only too glad and the lovers descended the marble steps
which led down gently to the sands. The moon glowed, pure silver in a sky of the
darkest blue, with the old moon in her radiant arms. In dark ripples, fringed
with creaming white, the wavelets murmured on the sands, and at either side of
the bay great cliffs bulked, huge and densely black. It was a night of soft
winds and glorious moonshine, fit for Romeo and Juliet to converse about love,
yet Lillian still harped on the prosaic facts of the dangers she and Dan had
escaped. Perhaps it was natural, for they had assuredly passed through a most
trying time. &quot;Why did Queen Beelzebub found such a wicked society?&quot; asked
Lillian. &quot;She wanted power and perverted her talents to base ends in order to
gain it, my dear. Well, well, she has gone to her account, so we need say no
more about her. She was a clever woman, but a fiend incarnate.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;And Mrs.
Jarsell?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Poor soul. She was but an example of the influence of a strong mind
on a weak one. I think she loathed the whole business thoroughly, but she had
gone too far to retreat.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Do you think Mrs. Pelgrin or her nephew knew anything
of the matter?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;No, I don't,&quot; said Halliday, very decidedly, &quot;although Tenson
had his suspicions of George. Mrs. Jarsell, who was used as a blind by Miss
Armour, in her turn used George as a blind to say, if necessary, how seldom she
went to town. I forgot to tell you, Lillian, that the police discovered that
both Mrs. Jarsell and the leader of the society used frequently to motor for
miles and miles to different stations further down the line in order to reach
London without remark being made. Mrs. Jarsell only used the Thawley Station so
as to get George Pelgrin's evidence that she scarcely ever went to town. In that
way, of course, it was next door to impossible to connect two harmless old
ladies with these many dreadful murders.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;It was only your cleverness about
that scent which formed the link,&quot; said Lillian, proud of Dan's characteristic
sharpness, &quot;and by using the biplane to travel to Blackheath, when Mr. Durwin
was murdered, Mrs. Jarsell was able to get Mrs. Pelgrin to prove an alibi.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Oh,
it was chance that showed Mrs. Jarsell's complicity on that occasion, my dear,&quot;
said Dan, modestly; &quot;but that we went into that animated picture entertainment,
we should never have known she was at Blackheath. I suppose Miss Armour did not
feel equal to committing that particular crime, so sent Mrs. Jarsell to carry
out the job.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Miss Armour was never really paralyzed, I suppose?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;No. She
pretended to be when anyone paid a visit. Nor do I believe that either she or
Mrs. Jarsell were so old as they pretended to be. What a queer thing human
nature is,&quot; went on Dan, thoughtfully; &quot;here was Miss Armour, who could have
lived a very pleasant and comfortable life, plunging herself and that miserable
woman into dangerous crime just for the love of power. One would have thought
that she would have liked to show her power publicly, but she was quite content
to be a secret despot. I suppose it gave her a certain amount of pleasure,
though it is hard for a simple person like I am to see where it came in.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;But
her power could not have been exercised amidst public applause, Dan, seeing what
it meant.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Quite so. The police would soon have ended her career had her
infernal sway been known.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Do you think,&quot; asked Lillian, after a pause, &quot;that
the members of the society expected that explosion?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;No,&quot; answered Halliday,
very promptly. &quot;I do not, else, in spite of the danger, I believe the half, if
not the whole, of them would have run out even into the arms of the police to be
hanged in due course. But they seemed to have an enormous belief in Queen
Beelzebub, who was undoubtedly as clever as her father the devil. The members
expected that in some way she would manage to save them. But all the time--as I
guessed, although I could not understand what she was aiming at--she was
preparing some way of getting rid of the lot, herself included. She must have
summoned them to a pretended conference so as to house all under one roof and
then fire the mine. I expect she filled the cellars of <i>The Grange</i> ages ago
with dynamite, and arranged with Mrs. Jarsell to explode the mine. Of course,
where Mrs. Jarsell got the better of Queen Beelzebub was that she did not give
her the pleasure of revenging herself on me, and fired the dynamite
unexpectedly. While Miss Armour and her demons were thinking how to torture me,
they all went--well, we won't say where they went. But there wasn't enough left
of them to form a single human being.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;And there is an immense hole in the
ground where The Grange stood,&quot; said Lillian, with awe; &quot;Mr. Laurance told me,
and Mildred also.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I daresay that hole will form the basis of a legend in years
to come,&quot; was Dan's reply, &quot;and a very picturesque story can be made out of the
material supplied by that infernal woman. She was as wicked and cruel and
callous as that Ezzelin who played dice with the arch-fiend. By the way,
Lillian, I suppose Mildred Vincent was very much cut up over the death of her
uncle.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;No, she was not. Of course, she regretted his awful end, and that he
should have been so wicked, but he was never kind to her and she had not much
love for him. I don't know,&quot; ended Miss Moon, reflectively, &quot;if we can be sure
that he ever committed a crime.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yes, he did,&quot; declared Halliday, quickly;
&quot;every single member of that society had to commit a crime in order to belong to
the gang. Vincent, I truly believe, was not a bad man, as his sole idea was a
craze for inventing aeroplanes. But Queen Beelzebub, wanting him for her
purpose, no doubt inveigled him into committing himself as a criminal, as she
inveigled Mrs. Jarsell and Curberry.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Poor Lord Curberry,&quot; sighed Lillian; &quot;he
is more to be pitied than blamed. I don't think the young man who holds the
title now cared that he died.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Can you expect him to?&quot; asked Dan, sceptically,
&quot;seeing he has got a title and a lot of money. In a clean way, too, for Curberry
consented to the murder of two relatives so as to secure what he wanted. No,
Lillian, it is your kind heart that makes you pity Curberry, but he was not a
good man. No decent fellow would have belonged to that association of demons.
But I think we have discussed the subject threadbare. Let us talk of more
pleasant matters.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;About Mr. Laurance and his marriage?&quot; cried Lillian, gaily.
&quot;Well, yes, although being selfishly in love, I would much rather discuss our
own. Freddy will be able to marry Mildred now since you have given him enough
money to start a newspaper. It is very good of you.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I don't think so,&quot; said
Miss Moon, as they began to climb the steps again, and return to the house. &quot;Mr.
Laurance helped you to learn who killed my dear father, and deserved a reward,
as you did. I gave him money and----&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;And you gave me yourself, so I have been
rewarded very richly. Well, Freddy will make a very good proprietor and editor
of a newspaper, and Mildred can help him to make it a success. All's well that
ends well.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;And you are quite--quite happy, dear?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Quite, quite. Only I fear,&quot;
Dan sighed, &quot;that some people will call me a fortune hunter, seeing that I,
without a penny, am marrying a rich woman.&quot; Lillian stopped in the path up to
the house and took hold of the lapels of Dan's coat to shake him. &quot;How can you
talk such nonsense,&quot; she said reproachfully; &quot;why, after your portrait and an
account of all you have done appearing in the papers, you could have married
half a dozen women.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;But none so sweet as you, dear,&quot; said Halliday, kissing
her, for her lips were temptingly near his own; &quot;well, I must not despise my
good fortune. But what can I give you in return, Miss Cr&#339;sus?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;A promise,&quot;
said Lillian, earnestly, &quot;that you will not go up any more in those horrid
flying-machines. I shall always be afraid of losing you if you do; you know that
quite well.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Let me take a tiny little flight occasionally,&quot; coaxed Dan, gaily.
&quot;Well, yes, on condition that you take me. If there is an accident, we can be
smashed up together. Don't argue;&quot; she placed her hand on his mouth; &quot;that is
the only way in which I shall agree to your flying.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Wilful woman will do what
she wants,&quot; said Halliday, resignedly, and tucked Lillian's arm beneath his own;
&quot;hello, there is Sir John and Mrs. Bolstreath on the terrace. They seem to be
very happy together.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;So happy,&quot; whispered Lillian in his ear, &quot;that I
believe----&quot; She pursed up her lips and looked unutterable things. &quot;Well,&quot; said
Dan, laughing, &quot;it would not be at all a bad thing for Sir John to make Mrs.
Bolstreath Lady Moon. She can nurse him and amuse him and bury him in due
course. What a heap of marriages; you and I; Freddy and Mildred; Sir John and
Mrs. Bolstreath. See; she's waving her hand to us. Let us go inside, as it's
growing a trifle chilly.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Hark,&quot; said Lillian, raising her finger, and Dan
listened to hear the wild, delicious strain of a nightingale singing from a
distant thicket. &quot;It sings of my love for you,&quot; he whispered, &quot;and of your love
for me. What other than such a song can express our feelings, darling.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;This,&quot;
said Lillian, and kissed him fondly.</p>

<p>&quot;Clever girl!&quot;</p>

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
